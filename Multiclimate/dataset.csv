783,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-083.jpg, And this is why it's important to come together there's also need for research.,train
784,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-084.jpg, There's need for documentation of not only the health impacts but how do you actually mitigate those.,train
785,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-085.jpg, And the health impacts of addressing some of these risk factors need to be documented and measured so that again for policy makers it's important to and understand the cost effectiveness of intervention.,train

2117,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-002.jpg,good morning john so probably you have heard that for a long time the amount of energy entering the earth's atmosphere and the amount leaving the earth's atmosphere was about the same ,train
2118,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-003.jpg,and that was good because if those two numbers are not equal then we're either getting colder every year or we're getting hotter every year ,train
2119,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-004.jpg,but now it looks like there is in fact more energy coming in than going out ,train
2120,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-005.jpg,and that results in basically three things ,train
2121,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-006.jpg,first more heat which is what we call like individual molecules moving faster which is wild ,train
2122,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-007.jpg,like when you are hot it is because the molecules that make up your body are jiggling more doesn't seem real but it is,train
2123,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-008.jpg,second you have more severe weather which is when a lot of molecules together move around more ,train
2124,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-009.jpg,and because of those two you have number three which is probably the worst of them ,train
2125,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-010.jpg,things are different that doesn't sound so bad except that we have built a tremendous amount of our human infrastructure designed based on the idea that things will be roughly the same now as they were in the past with regards to rainfall and temperature and stuff like that ,train
2126,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-011.jpg,things are different that doesn't sound so bad except that we have built a tremendous amount of our human infrastructure designed based on the idea that things will be roughly the same now as they were in the past with regards to rainfall and temperature and stuff like that ,train
2127,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-012.jpg,when that stuff changes crops might have dramatically lower yields resulting in very hungry people ,train
2128,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-013.jpg,people might use their air conditioners way more than in the past so entire power grids fail ,train

2130,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-015.jpg,so that's bad and always the first thing you should ask when something bad is happening is why is that happening,train
2131,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-016.jpg,well you know when you go outside wearing a black t-shirt you get hotter faster than if you're wearing a white t-shirt ,train
2132,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-017.jpg,that's because things only look black if they absorb all of the visible light that is hitting them,train
2133,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-018.jpg,if the light was not being absorbed it would either be reflected as white light or as a mirror or it would be clear which would be a strange choice for a shirt ,train
2134,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-019.jpg,so if you're wearing a white shirt the visible light isn't being absorbed it's being reflected and that's why you're less hot,train
2135,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-020.jpg,absorb reflect or let pass through that's basically the only three things that a material can do with light,train
2136,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-021.jpg,and if the light is being absorbed that means the energy of the light hit the molecule in such a way that it's creating movement in the molecule ,train
2137,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-022.jpg,the light no longer exists the energy is now movement,train
2138,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-023.jpg,and that movement can be transferred to other molecules just like a cue ball hitting a pool ball ,train
2139,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-024.jpg,there are basically two ways a molecule can heat up and we just talked about both of them,train
2140,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-025.jpg,the first is that a photon travels through space and then gets absorbed by a molecule and speeds up that molecule that's heat from radiation ,train
2141,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-026.jpg,and the second way is that a particle that's jiggling a lot hits a particle that's jiggling less and transfers its heat to that other molecule,train
2142,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-027.jpg,when that happens in a solid we call it conduction when it happens in a fluid we call it convection ,train
2143,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-028.jpg,so like when you're in the shade 99 of the heat you are feeling is from convection it's molecules in the air running into you and transferring their heat to you ,train
2144,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-029.jpg,but when you're in the sun it's a mix of both the radiation and the convection which is why it's hotter in the sun ,train
2145,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-030.jpg,now different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light ,train
2146,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-031.jpg,like this book cover is mostly absorbing everything but yellow and this one is mostly absorbing everything but red ,train
2147,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-032.jpg,and the red and the yellow are being reflected back and this can also happen with gases ,train
2148,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-033.jpg,there can be green gases and yellow gases and brown gases ,train
2149,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-034.jpg,but the two molecules of interest here carbon dioxide and methane they don't absorb any light in the visible spectrum which means that they are clear we can't see them ,train
2150,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-035.jpg,one of the problems with methane actually if your house is filling up with it you need to make sure that you know that that's happening but you can't see it ,train
2151,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-036.jpg,but at certain infrared wavelengths which the sun creates a lot of they are black ,train
2152,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-037.jpg,and when we put more of them in the atmosphere our atmosphere is a little less clear in those wavelengths and it's a little more black ,train
2153,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-038.jpg,those molecules absorb photons they start to move around faster they knock into other molecules which also start to move around faster they push on each other more and more until they have lower pressure and that hot air starts to rise,train
2154,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-039.jpg,those molecules absorb photons they start to move around faster they knock into other molecules which also start to move around faster they push on each other more and more until they have lower pressure and that hot air starts to rise,train
2155,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-040.jpg,cooler denser air rushes in to take its place and that's weather now,train
2156,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-041.jpg,those hot air molecules might remove more moisture from the soil resulting in more wildfires ,train
2157,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-042.jpg,they might evaporate more water from the ocean resulting in bigger storms ,train
2158,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-043.jpg,we know that this happens we know how this happens we know why this happens and we know what the effects are ,train
2159,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-044.jpg,and we know that the only way to stop it is for there to be less co2 and methane in the atmosphere but that is a very hard thing to do,train
2160,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-045.jpg,it's very hard and expensive to remove those things from the atmosphere ,train
