1,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, The UK is committed to tackling climate change. 
2,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, The climate change act is a pioneering piece of legislation that has been supported by every UK government since 2008.
3,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, It obliges the UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels and to adapt to the risks associated with a warming planet.

8,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, Part of our work involves advising the government on carbon budgets.
9,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, Carbon budgets place a limit on greenhouse gas emissions during five year time periods.
10,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, We then report to Parliament on progress towards meeting those budgets.
11,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, We also advise on ways the UK should prepare for the impacts of climate change.
12,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-003.jpg, These impacts include increased flooding heat waves water shortages new pests and diseases and other risks. 
13,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-003.jpg, And we highlight where there are opportunities for UK businesses.
14,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, New low-carbon products and services are a fast-growing part of the economy. 
15,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-001.jpg, The Committee on climate change is an independent public body made up of highly experienced committee members including scientists businesspeople engineers and economists.

21,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, The climate change Act provides the framework to the UK to find solutions to one of the greatest challenges facing humanity.
22,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, The UK has made good progress so far.
23,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, For over a quarter of a century UK greenhouse gas emissions have been falling while GDP has increased.
24,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, And we have begun to address flooding risks and other dangers.
25,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, But more action is needed if this progress is to continue.
26,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/ACCC/ACCC_frames/ACCC-002.jpg, That's where we come in the Committee on climate change.

30,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-003.jpg, Air pollution levels in China are often dangerously high.
31,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-004.jpg, Concentrations of fine particulates the most damaging form of air pollution for health are often more than ten times the level recommended by the World Health Organization.
32,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-005.jpg, Concentrations of fine particulates the most damaging form of air pollution for health are often more than ten times the level recommended by the World Health Organization.
33,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-006.jpg, Concentrations of fine particulates the most damaging form of air pollution for health are often more than ten times the level recommended by the World Health Organization.
34,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-007.jpg, Pollution levels like what you see here in China are relatively common in many developing countries.
35,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-008.jpg, This shows you premature mortality rates due to ambient air pollution around the world.
36,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-009.jpg, Estimates are that about four million premature deaths occurred in 2012 according to the global burden of disease report most of these deaths over ninety percent incurred in low and middle income countries.
37,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-010.jpg, Estimates are that about four million premature deaths occurred in 2012 according to the global burden of disease report most of these deaths over ninety percent incurred in low and middle income countries.

39,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-012.jpg, China has among the highest ambient air pollution concentrations in the world.
40,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-013.jpg, Two months ago I was in Beijing giving a talk at Ching hua University and these three professors insisted we put on face masks before heading out to dinner.
41,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-014.jpg, China recognizes how health damaging its air pollution is and there is very committed now to finding ways to reduce emissions and improve air quality
42,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-015.jpg, China recognizes how health damaging its air pollution is and there is very committed now to finding ways to reduce emissions and improve air quality
43,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-016.jpg, In addition to having terrible air pollution problems China is also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world.
44,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-017.jpg, Currently more than double u.s. emissions and triple the emissions from the European Union.
45,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-018.jpg, You can see the emissions from China are beginning to flatten and it looks highly likely that they will meet or exceed their commitment in the Paris agreement to peaking co2 emissions on ER before 2030.
46,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-019.jpg, You can see the emissions from China are beginning to flatten and it looks highly likely that they will meet or exceed their commitment in the Paris agreement to peaking co2 emissions on ER before 2030.
47,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-020.jpg, I decided to reorient my research to looking at opportunities for co-benefits and mitigating air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
48,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-021.jpg, Because there's many opportunities to do both things together.
49,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-022.jpg, But there's also opportunity to do them independently and sometimes there's perverse consequences of that.
50,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-023.jpg, There's opportunities to increase efficiency of end use processes which therefore reduce emissions of air pollutants and carbon dioxide simultaneously and to electrify.
51,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-024.jpg, There's opportunities to increase efficiency of end use processes which therefore reduce emissions of air pollutants and carbon dioxide simultaneously and to electrify.
52,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-025.jpg, particularly if that electrification happens with non fossil fuels you have Co Bennett's for air quality and for climate.
53,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-026.jpg, Transmission is a really important aspect of renewable generation in use because renewables are inherently intermittent.
54,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-027.jpg, Transmission is a really important aspect of renewable generation in use because renewables are inherently intermittent.
55,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-028.jpg, And China is now building long distance transmission lines that take power from western China to the east where the demand is higher the pollution levels are higher the exposure is higher.
56,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-029.jpg, You see here fine particulate pollution coming from stoves which we use in residences causing very high levels of indoor air pollution.
57,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-030.jpg, You see here fine particulate pollution coming from stoves which we use in residences causing very high levels of indoor air pollution.
58,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-031.jpg, Our recent research have shown that not only is an airport at the indoor level problematic but this is contributing about 50% of fine particle pollution in winter in the provinces surrounding Beijing.
59,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-032.jpg, Our recent research have shown that not only is an airport at the indoor level problematic but this is contributing about 50% of fine particle pollution in winter in the provinces surrounding Beijing.
60,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-033.jpg, Electrification of those stoves would virtually eliminate that pollution source.
61,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-034.jpg, The way we do our analysis is we start with the current emissions.
62,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-035.jpg, And then we look at various interventions and the emission reductions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases that can result.
63,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-036.jpg, And then we use atmospheric models to simulate the air pollution reductions.
64,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-037.jpg, And then we estimate the improvements in health and climate that result from those interventions.
65,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-038.jpg, What we've found is an increasing efficiency of end-use processes in the industrial sector and putting end of pipe controls on a variety of different sources like the power sector and vehicles can reduce premature mortality 'z and co2 emissions in China today.
66,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-039.jpg, What we've found is an increasing efficiency of end-use processes in the industrial sector and putting end of pipe controls on a variety of different sources like the power sector and vehicles can reduce premature mortality 'z and co2 emissions in China today.
67,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-040.jpg, Technology is immediately available to do that.
68,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-041.jpg, However electrifying end use applications like vehicles and those stoves can further reduce air pollution emissions and have large benefits for health.
69,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-042.jpg, However electrifying end use applications like vehicles and those stoves can further reduce air pollution emissions and have large benefits for health.
70,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-043.jpg, However if that electrification is done with coal.
71,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-044.jpg, It has relatively little benefits for climate and for co2 mitigation.
72,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-045.jpg, If that electrification occurs using renewable energy and that those transmission lines that are being built facilitate the transmission of that renewable energy from west to east.
73,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-046.jpg, If that electrification occurs using renewable energy and that those transmission lines that are being built facilitate the transmission of that renewable energy from west to east.
74,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-047.jpg, We find that if 50 percent of the stoves and 50 percent of the vehicles are electrified with 50 percent renewable energy.
75,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-048.jpg, China would achieve a 10 percent improvement in reduction in premature mortality and a 25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
76,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-049.jpg, China is very committed to increasing its renewable energy generation.
77,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-050.jpg, It's committed now at 360 billion dollars through the end of 2022 renewable generation for like solar and wind.
78,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-051.jpg, It's committed now at 360 billion dollars through the end of 2022 renewable generation for like solar and wind.
79,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-052.jpg, And they estimate that will generate about 13 million jobs in China over that time period.
80,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-053.jpg, Renewable energy provides huge opportunities not only in China but around the world for reducing co2 emissions and improving air quality
81,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-054.jpg, There's ample opportunities to provide electricity generation.
82,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-055.jpg, There's challenges that still remain on storage and transmission.
83,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-056.jpg, But we're seeing that there's breakthroughs coming down the pike in the next few years.
84,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-057.jpg, There's opportunities here to turn the skies of of Beijing from from gray to blue and improve the global climate for everyone.
85,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AIAQ/AIAQ_frames/AIAQ-058.jpg, Both within China and around the world.

119,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-011.jpg, And some is trapped by the atmosphere which keep the earth warm.
120,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-012.jpg, However the shop increase of the greenhouse gas is overheating us.

127,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-019.jpg, This is our instrument the ultra portable greenhouse gas analyzer from Los Gatos research.
128,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-020.jpg, The left side panel includes gas Inlet Port gas exhaust ports.
129,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-021.jpg, The right side panel includes many different data interference ports.
130,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-022.jpg, It has a built-in computer and you only need to connect a monitor and the mouse.
131,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-023.jpg, It uses a cavity enhanced laser absorption spectrometry to measure the gas concentration.
132,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-024.jpg, This instrument has very high sensitivity this is what happens when our Excel air to the tube connected to the inlet Port.
133,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-025.jpg, The carbon dioxide and water vapor increase dramatically.
134,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-026.jpg, This is the Frozen Douglas Lake near the University of Michigan Biological Station.
135,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-027.jpg, The forest and ground are covered by a thick layer of snow.
136,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-028.jpg, I dig a hole in the snow and put our self-made chamber on the ground.
137,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-029.jpg, Then two tubes are used to connect the chamber to the inlet and exhaust ports of the instrument to form a closed system.

141,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-033.jpg, Now let's look into the measuremented data.
142,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-034.jpg, Does the concentration of medicine emitted from soil for three days from February 4th to 6th at um Biological Station.
143,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-035.jpg, Does the concentration of medicine emitted from soil for three days from February 4th to 6th at um Biological Station.
144,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-036.jpg, The red line shows the temperature you can see there is a time lag between the methane concentration and temperature.
145,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-037.jpg, It is because most molecules need time to generate and release from soil.
146,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-038.jpg, Generally the higher temperature the higher medicine concentration released from soil.
147,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-039.jpg, We also measure the carbon dioxide and Vapor concentration.
148,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-040.jpg, We observed that they also have a strong relation with temperature.
149,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-041.jpg, Next We compare two adjacent days with similar temperature but there was snow on the second day.
150,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/AMCC/AMCC_frames/AMCC-042.jpg, Next We compare two adjacent days with similar temperature but there was snow on the second day.

217,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-002.jpg, Hello andreas people here in mtl are very obsessed by bitcoin's over consumption of energy in regards of climate change.
218,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-003.jpg, Would i be wrong to answer them that bitcoin's non-inflationary policy will probably help save the world.
219,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-004.jpg, Yeah i mean that argument won't get you very far guillaume because here's the thing.
220,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-005.jpg, People who make this argument have usually a very specific bias or agenda that is very difficult to shift.

223,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-008.jpg, First of all they confuse energy production with energy consumption and see the two as equivalent.
224,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-009.jpg, This would be the same as saying that electric cars harm the environment because they use more energy in total than gasoline cars.
225,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-010.jpg, This would be the same as saying that electric cars harm the environment because they use more energy in total than gasoline cars.
226,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-011.jpg, But that's ignoring the side effects of concentrating production of energy and regulating it as well as distributing the consumption in that way.
227,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-012.jpg, This would be the same as saying that electric cars harm the environment because they use more energy in total than gasoline cars.
228,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-013.jpg, Obviously the distribution of gas and oil is much more harmful to the environment.
229,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-014.jpg, And theoretically at least if you're producing the electricity for your teslas with coal-fired power plants.
230,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-015.jpg, They're more damaging to the environment you don't hear them saying this argument however.

232,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-017.jpg, Because it is much easier to regulate the production of energy in one place at the electricity plant than regulate the emissions of a billion vehicles that are distributed all around the place so if you shift the emissions from the end point to the source.

249,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-034.jpg, In the end bitcoin subsidizes renewable energy.
250,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-035.jpg, But that argument won't get you very far if the people are not interested in good faith arguments.
251,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-036.jpg, But are interested simply in finding it's another way to bash bitcoin.
252,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-037.jpg, Just ignore it just ignore it you don't want pollution and carbon dioxide great regulate energy production.
253,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/BECCC/BECCC_frames/BECCC-038.jpg, If you're worried about pollution regulate energy production.

646,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFS/CCFS_frames/CCFS-016.jpg, Fred could always choose to eat fish instead but fish reserves are already at an all-time low due to overfishing and pollution.
647,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFS/CCFS_frames/CCFS-017.jpg, Not only that climate change will also have a negative effect on the fish stock.

676,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-003.jpg, We know weather is unpredictable.
677,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-004.jpg, And extreme events have always occurred. We also know these events are becoming more severe and more common.
678,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-005.jpg, And yes these shifts are down to climate change.
679,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-006.jpg, So what's the science behind all this?
680,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-007.jpg, Let's start with greenhouse gases as you probably know these are released when we do things like burn fossil fuels.
681,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-008.jpg, When this happens heat becomes trapped near the earth's surface making it hotter here on land and in the ocean.

684,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-011.jpg, Of course this means more evaporation more water vapor in the air and more heavy rainfall.
685,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-012.jpg, Some places get less some places get more but when it rains it can pour.
686,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCFWW/CCFWW_frames/CCFWW-013.jpg, While all this is going on let's not forget the heat hotter days mean higher fire risk especially in drought prone areas.

744,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-044.jpg, Diversifying the cereals that we eat not doing monoculture and of course protecting the forests preventing deforestation and and degradation.
745,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-045.jpg, Because there we are increasing the the chances of animal human conflict as well as wild animals and domestic animals coming into contact.

747,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-047.jpg, And this is where the spillover events are likely to occur in the next virus that causes pandemic is likely to to arise.
748,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-048.jpg, And this is where the spillover events are likely to occur in the next virus that causes pandemic is likely to to arise.
749,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-049.jpg, So what specifically should governments in Asia and the Pacific be doing.
750,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-050.jpg, What measures could they take so I think governments need to start thinking very broadly about uh what are the Investments that will help the environment slow down climate change.
751,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-051.jpg, What measures could they take so I think governments need to start thinking very broadly about uh what are the Investments that will help the environment slow down climate change.
752,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-052.jpg, Reduce amount of carbon we're emitting.
753,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-053.jpg, And at the same time helping the health of people and reducing some of these risk factors today which are unhealthy diets poor quality.
754,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-054.jpg, Uh you know that we're breathing.
755,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-055.jpg, And um you know these commercial other determinants with people eating high salt high fat high sugar food.
756,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-056.jpg, And um you know these commercial other determinants with people eating high salt high fat high sugar food.
757,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-057.jpg, So there are lots of policy levers that can be put in place you're putting a lot of emphasis that the onus really on governments to affect change.
758,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-058.jpg, But what role and responsibility do we as individuals have to tackle the crisis?
759,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-059.jpg, There also needs to be a people's movement that recognizes this.
760,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-060.jpg, Because a lot of it is also individual Behavior change.
761,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-061.jpg, You know take public transport or or take a bicycle and walk if you can rather than taking your car.
762,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-062.jpg, You know buy locally available produce support your local farmers save electricity in your homes as much as possible.
763,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-063.jpg, You know buy locally available produce support your local farmers save electricity in your homes as much as possible.
764,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-064.jpg, And and while proportionately speaking the amount of emissions of people living in small countries or large countries in Asia Pacific is maybe less than some of the Western High income countries.
765,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-065.jpg, And and while proportionately speaking the amount of emissions of people living in small countries or large countries in Asia Pacific is maybe less than some of the Western High income countries.
766,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-066.jpg, I think everybody now has to do their bit and moving to renewable energy sources for example if you put together all the healthcare facilities in the world it's the fifth largest emitter of carbon.
767,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-067.jpg, I think everybody now has to do their bit and moving to renewable energy sources for example if you put together all the healthcare facilities in the world it's the fifth largest emitter of carbon.
768,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-068.jpg, So I think just Greening Healthcare facilities itself can help to you know reduce and then of course.
769,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-069.jpg, So I think just Greening Healthcare facilities itself can help to you know reduce and then of course.
770,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-070.jpg, We need the adaptation we need to ensure that if there's a flood if there's a drought that the health system is resilient it's able to cope it's able to provide services.
771,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-071.jpg, We need the adaptation we need to ensure that if there's a flood if there's a drought that the health system is resilient it's able to cope it's able to provide services.
772,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-072.jpg, And again we need to start thinking about how are we going to provide these Services when we are when we are hit with these climate emergencies.
773,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-073.jpg, So are you seeing positive actions any hopeful signs coming from Asia in the Pacific?
774,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-074.jpg, Yes in fact at the last Corp.
775,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-075.jpg, I think Health was an important uh issue and it had a lot of traction.
776,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-076.jpg, And the who has launched an alliance of countries that want to be part of moving into renewable sources of energy and and really addressing climate and health.
777,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-077.jpg, And the who has launched an alliance of countries that want to be part of moving into renewable sources of energy and and really addressing climate and health.
778,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-078.jpg, So this Alliance today has about 54 countries.
779,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-079.jpg, And I think you know sharing best practices sharing knowledge.
780,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-080.jpg, You know making sure that the norms and standards are known and accepted in every country.
781,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-081.jpg, And and really building this movement for which health professionals need to be advocates for.
782,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-082.jpg, But the action often needs to be taken by people outside the health sector.
783,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-083.jpg, And this is why it's important to come together there's also need for research.
784,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-084.jpg, There's need for documentation of not only the health impacts but how do you actually mitigate those.
785,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-085.jpg, And the health impacts of addressing some of these risk factors need to be documented and measured so that again for policy makers it's important to and understand the cost effectiveness of intervention.
786,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-086.jpg, And the health impacts of addressing some of these risk factors need to be documented and measured so that again for policy makers it's important to and understand the cost effectiveness of intervention.
787,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-087.jpg, So there's a lot of work that's needed there but at the same time we also have today the knowledge and tools to start acting we don't need to wait.
788,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-088.jpg, So is this some of the work that you're involved in in your role as scientists for instance is the who providing data which could drive effective policy decisions?
789,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-089.jpg, So is this some of the work that you're involved in in your role as scientists for instance is the who providing data which could drive effective policy decisions?

791,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-091.jpg, That's right and one of the new mechanisms we're using is something called living guidelines where we are constantly updating the recommendations that we've made without waiting for several years to go by.
792,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-092.jpg, That's right and one of the new mechanisms we're using is something called living guidelines where we are constantly updating the recommendations that we've made without waiting for several years to go by.
793,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-093.jpg, And this will be up all on a digital platform.
794,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-094.jpg, And so this enables people around the world to look at what the latest standards guidelines recommendations are from The Who.
795,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-095.jpg, And we are continuously looking at the data that's evolving.
796,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-096.jpg, And there are huge amounts of data so we also need to use Technologies like artificial intelligence.
797,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-097.jpg, That's scanning the literature pulling the data and triggering to us and telling us it's time for an updating your recommendations.
798,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-098.jpg, That's scanning the literature pulling the data and triggering to us and telling us it's time for an updating your recommendations.
799,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-099.jpg, So this is a process we started during the pandemic and this is now growing across all the technical Departments of who.
800,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-100.jpg, We also have a department of digital health and Innovation.
801,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-101.jpg, And again we've seen digital Technologies being used so much more during the pandemic.
802,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-102.jpg, And so again learning you know how can we harness Telehealth telemedicine the the use of apps on mobile phones.
803,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-103.jpg, All of this can help us it can be an enabler.
804,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-104.jpg, But again we need to remember that it it is possible that the same people who were excluded from accessing Health Services.
805,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-105.jpg, May be excluded because they don't have access to digital Technologies.
806,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-106.jpg, They don't have access to the internet still half the world does not have access to Internet even though they may own a mobile phone.
807,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-107.jpg, They don't have access to the internet still half the world does not have access to Internet even though they may own a mobile phone.
808,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-108.jpg, And so I think as we invest in Technologies we we have to again keep Equity at the heart.
809,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-109.jpg, And think about that last Mile and that you know vulnerable individual whether it's an elderly person who is you know disabled and cannot leave home or whether it's a indigenous person living in a remote Community.
810,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-110.jpg, And think about that last Mile and that you know vulnerable individual whether it's an elderly person who is you know disabled and cannot leave home or whether it's a indigenous person living in a remote Community.
811,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-111.jpg, How do we make sure the same Quality Health Services reach them?
812,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-112.jpg, How do we make sure the same Quality Health Services reach them?
813,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCH/CCH_frames/CCH-113.jpg, So lots of food for thought there both for policy makers in the region and for all of us as we Face the health and climate challenges up ahead.

838,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-020.jpg, Since I've moved here 50 years ago I've noticed a tremendous change in temperature.
839,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-021.jpg, Now is a lot hotter and the temperature just keeps rising.
840,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-022.jpg, We have a basketball hoop in our front yard.
841,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-023.jpg, And I would love playing basketball like every day but it's way too hot to do it.

843,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-025.jpg, It's going to impact all of us but certain populations are more vulnerable to climate change.
844,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-026.jpg, We applied with our Community Health Partners to develop a heat vulnerability index where we looked at all of Denver's neighborhoods.
845,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-027.jpg, And we looked at all the factors that would cause that community to be particularly vulnerable to extreme heat.
846,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-028.jpg, And we looked at all the factors that would cause that community to be particularly vulnerable to extreme heat.
847,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-029.jpg, What they have in common is that there's a large percentage of families.
848,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-030.jpg, Who are at or below the poverty level of individuals with certain health conditions like diabetes.
849,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-031.jpg, Individuals who are elderly or with disabilities.
850,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-032.jpg, [Music] I myself get sick if the temperature rises so for about seventy-five degrees.
851,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-033.jpg, I start feeling it I get a little nauseous.
852,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-034.jpg, My head gets a little bit dizzy.
853,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-035.jpg, One of the questions we've been asking as researchers is what does climate change how does it impact human health and is it going to make new diseases.
854,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-036.jpg, The answer is it's not new diseases that we get it.
855,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-037.jpg, It's really a force multiplier but people that have existing conditions like asthma under a heat stress more pollution more ozone that would exacerbate the conditions that I always have.
856,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-038.jpg, I have four kids and a stepson and only one of them doesn't have asthma.

859,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-041.jpg, This is totally preventable why aren't we doing more about.
860,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-042.jpg, The rising heat it affects my health my breathing.
861,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-043.jpg, Because I have asthma now when I feel that heat coming on I can't breathe.
862,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-044.jpg, My throat hurts.

867,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-049.jpg, So when you throw the heat into the mix.
868,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-050.jpg, I just get more and more tired faster.
869,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-051.jpg, I need a I drink water by the gallon every day

898,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-080.jpg, And I want to stop that as soon as we can.
899,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-081.jpg, If we all get together and we all push towards something that at least.
900,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCHES/CCHES_frames/CCHES-082.jpg, The conversation has started and people become more aware everything.

906,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-003.jpg, We're sitting just above the village of Charlotte Pass in Kosciuszko National Park.
907,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-004.jpg, And this is a place that I've been working doing research and teaching in for about the past 20 years.
908,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-005.jpg, What's really caught my attention at the moment is thinking about the mountains in the changing climate.
909,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-006.jpg, And the plants and animals that are found here many of them are not found anywhere else. 
910,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-007.jpg, And the plants and animals that are found here many of them are not found anywhere else. 
911,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-008.jpg, They're not found at lower elevations many of them require snow to complete their life cycle. 
912,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-009.jpg, So one of the things that I think we don't realise is how much the micro environment - the space around a plant - can change over the course of a day or even minutes. 
913,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-010.jpg, So one of the things that I think we don't realise is how much the micro environment - the space around a plant - can change over the course of a day or even minutes. 
914,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-011.jpg, The temperature for example of a leaf as the sun rises will go from -2 to 25 degrees.
915,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-012.jpg, So it goes from really cold and frozen to really quite warm.
916,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-013.jpg, And then if the sun shines on it it'll get much hotter than the temperature of the air or anything else around it.
917,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-014.jpg, And to me that's really fascinating.
918,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-015.jpg, That you've got an organism that can alter its temperature so dramatically over such a short period of time.
919,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-016.jpg, If you think about us we don't change temperature whereas these things are capable of doing that repeatedly over really quick time scales. 
920,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-017.jpg, If you think about us we don't change temperature whereas these things are capable of doing that repeatedly over really quick time scales. 
921,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-018.jpg, So in 2020 there are several things that happened that have caused us to stop re-evaluate and think carefully about what we need to do next.
922,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-019.jpg, And how we want to go forward.  
923,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-020.jpg, It began with the bushfires and the bushfires meant that that my team had to really rethink what they were going to do.
924,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-021.jpg, Because we couldn't get into our field sites for quite a long time.
925,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-022.jpg, And some of the places that we were working or planning to work were fire affected. 
926,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-023.jpg, Then there was a hailstorm in Canberra that took out all of our glasshouses.
927,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-024.jpg, And with it experiments that we'd been working on for three years that were within a few months of completion and all of that was before the pandemic.

929,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-026.jpg, I think for me 2020 was about really paring things back really thinking about priorities and thinking about what are the important things to keep going and to maintain.

932,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-029.jpg, I was particularly struck by the impact that this event will have on the coming generation and really thinking about how it changes the way.

935,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-032.jpg, I think 2020 has demonstrated to all of us that really extreme things can come out of the blue.
936,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-033.jpg, And that one of the few things you can predict is that there's going to be a lot of unpredictable stuff happening over the coming years.
937,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-034.jpg, And so to me it's been about thinking.
938,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-035.jpg, What is the baseline? 
939,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-036.jpg, What is the information that we need to be monitoring? 
940,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-037.jpg, So we can detect change and think about how we're going to manage and respond and try to maintain the values of these spectacular landscapes. 
941,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-038.jpg, So we can detect change and think about how we're going to manage and respond and try to maintain the values of these spectacular landscapes. 
942,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-039.jpg, And on the more personal side it's really about thinking about how do we make sure that the next generation has the tools that they need to come up with creative solutions for unpredictable problems.
943,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAA/CCIAA_frames/CCIAA-040.jpg, And on the more personal side it's really about thinking about how do we make sure that the next generation has the tools that they need to come up with creative solutions for unpredictable problems.

956,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAH/CCIAH_frames/CCIAH-010.jpg, It's impacting all of us.
957,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAH/CCIAH_frames/CCIAH-011.jpg, It's hard to imagine a dimension of human health that climate change doesn't touch.
958,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAH/CCIAH_frames/CCIAH-012.jpg, It deepens poverty. It threatens our food and water supply.
959,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIAH/CCIAH_frames/CCIAH-013.jpg, It tears people from their homes. It makes large parts of the world uninhabitable.

1023,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-007.jpg, You know climate change seems like a really big deal why are so few people talking about it?
1024,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-008.jpg, Why have so few thought leaders made it their signature issue?
1025,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-009.jpg, And another reasonably prominent left of centre pundit piped up and said Well for my part the reason I don't talk about.
1026,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-010.jpg, It is it seems really complicated.
1027,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-011.jpg, I don't feel like I have a good grasp on all the science and so I just don't feel qualified to go out and assert things publicly about it.

1036,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-020.jpg, You have to go online and research and read and be able to respond to them in detail and a lot of people just find that prospect dreary.
1037,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-021.jpg, And so they don't bother. And this of course drives me crazy.
1038,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-022.jpg, So I piped up on Twitter and said You know climate change is not actually that complicated.
1039,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-023.jpg, What you need to know to be able to speak out publicly about it just about the basic structure of the problem.
1040,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-024.jpg, What you need to know to be able to speak out publicly about it just about the basic structure of the problem.
1041,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-025.jpg, It is really not that complicated I could explain it to you in 15 minutes.
1042,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-026.jpg, So let this be a lesson to you.
1043,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-027.jpg, Don't go talk smack on Twitter Unless you are willing to back it up. 
1044,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-028.jpg, So one thing led to another and here I am With 15 minutes to explain climate change to you. So let's get started.
1045,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-029.jpg, Why is the Earth not a cold dead rock floating in space?
1046,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-030.jpg, The reason is that it is enveloped by this tiny tiny thin layer of gases and chemicals.
1047,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-031.jpg, The reason is that it is enveloped by this tiny tiny thin layer of gases and chemicals.
1048,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-032.jpg, That we call our atmosphere. So the Sun's energy rather than just coming down and bouncing right back off.
1049,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-033.jpg, It comes down and is held close to the surface of the Earth for a while.
1050,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-034.jpg, And then bounces off.
1051,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-035.jpg, And then this simple process is why we have evaporation and precipitation and photosynthesis and life on our planet.
1052,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-036.jpg, And then this simple process is why we have evaporation and precipitation and photosynthesis and life on our planet.
1053,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-037.jpg, So scientists discovered well over a hundred years ago that the atmosphere and the systems on Earth are in this dynamic relationship.
1054,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-038.jpg, And you can change the chemical composition of the atmosphere and hold more of the Sun's energy for longer.
1055,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-039.jpg, And you can change the chemical composition of the atmosphere and hold more of the Sun's energy for longer.
1056,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-040.jpg, The energy still has to escape of course but in the meantime it will cause changes in these biophysical systems of the Earth.
1057,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-041.jpg, And you know you often hear people say The Earth has always changed.
1058,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-042.jpg, the climate has always changed and that's true it has.
1059,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-043.jpg, This relationship between the atmosphere and the systems they go through cycles.
1060,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-044.jpg, but these cycles have typically taken hundreds of thousand of years millions of years.
1061,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-045.jpg, The key thing to know first is that for the last 10000 years on Earth.
1062,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-046.jpg, The climate has been relatively stable unusually stable.
1063,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-047.jpg, And by stable I mean temperature has varied.
1064,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-048.jpg, It's gone up and down but it's stayed on a fairly narrow band of about plus or minus 1 degree Celsius.
1065,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-049.jpg, And all of advanced human civilisation has taken place during these 10000 years.
1066,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-050.jpg, And all of advanced human civilisation has taken place during these 10000 years.
1067,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-051.jpg, The development of agriculture the written word the wheel the iPhone.
1068,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-052.jpg, Everything we know everything we have built we have done in this period of relative climate stability. 
1069,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-053.jpg, Everything we know everything we have built we have done in this period of relative climate stability. 
1070,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-054.jpg, So what we have been doing for the last couple of hundred years is digging up carbon out of the earth and throwing it up into the atmosphere and changing the chemical composition of the atmosphere like has happened in the past except for extremely faster.
1071,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-055.jpg, So what we have been doing for the last couple of hundred years is digging up carbon out of the earth and throwing it up into the atmosphere and changing the chemical composition of the atmosphere like has happened in the past except for extremely faster.
1072,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-056.jpg, In geological time the blink of an eye.
1073,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-057.jpg, we are substantially changing the chemical composition of the atmosphere and all of climate science has been about.
1074,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-058.jpg, What's going to happen? What is the Earth going to do in response to this?
1075,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-059.jpg, And so we've already seen that the process is underway.
1076,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-060.jpg, We have measured we have witnessed observed with our eyes and our thermometers about a 0.8ºC rise in global average temperature.
1077,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-061.jpg, We have measured we have witnessed observed with our eyes and our thermometers about a 0.8ºC rise in global average temperature.
1078,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-062.jpg, Since before the industrial age since before we started digging all this carbon up.
1079,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-063.jpg, And this may not seem like a lot -- less than 1ºC --
1080,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-064.jpg, But the thing to know about it is these greenhouse gases we throw up stay in the atmosphere for a very long time.
1081,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-065.jpg, There are very long time lags involved here.
1082,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-066.jpg, So this 0.8º temperature rise is a response to what we were doing 50-100 years ago.
1083,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-067.jpg, And what we see in the first half of this century will be a response to what we've done in the last 50 years.
1084,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-068.jpg, And what we see in the first half of this century will be a response to what we've done in the last 50 years.
1085,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-069.jpg, And what we'll see in the latter half of this century will be a response to decisions we make today.
1086,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-070.jpg, So the question is Temperature's rising how high does it have to rise before we need to worry before we're in danger before bad things start happening?
1087,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-071.jpg, So the question is Temperature's rising how high does it have to rise before we need to worry before we're in danger before bad things start happening?
1088,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-072.jpg, The typical answer to this question has been 2ºC.
1089,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-073.jpg, Anyone who has followed climate change discussions knows that this 2º number has taken on a kind of iconic quality.
1090,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-074.jpg, Anyone who has followed climate change discussions knows that this 2º number has taken on a kind of iconic quality.
1091,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-075.jpg, Typically climate scientists who model impacts of what's going to happen model 2ºC rise
1092,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-076.jpg, Typically economists who try to model what it would cost to do something about climate change or what it's worth or what various policies would cost model 2º centigrade.

1094,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-078.jpg, So obviously what counts as not dangerous vs dangerous is not a hard scientific question.
1095,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-079.jpg, It's a political question.
1096,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-080.jpg, And this was a political decision to take this 2C number.
1097,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-081.jpg, Mainly made by European climate negotiators well over 10 years ago
1098,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-082.jpg, And it's just sort of stuck since then. 
1099,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-083.jpg, All the countries involved in climate negotiations have basically signed on saying Yes this is what we want to avoid 2ºC temperature rise.
1100,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-084.jpg, The bad news on this 2C number is twofold.
1101,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-085.jpg, First of all all the latest science done in the last 10-15 years has pointed to the conclusion that those impacts we thought were going to happen around 2ºC are in fact going to happen much earlier than that the climate is more sensitive to these added greenhouse gases than we thought.
1102,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-086.jpg, First of all all the latest science done in the last 10-15 years has pointed to the conclusion that those impacts we thought were going to happen around 2ºC are in fact going to happen much earlier than that the climate is more sensitive to these added greenhouse gases than we thought.

1106,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-090.jpg, So if those were the impacts we were worried about.
1107,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-091.jpg, Then the real threshold of safety ought to be something like 1.5ºC.
1108,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-092.jpg, James Hansen is the climate scientist most famously known for raising these warnings.
1109,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-093.jpg, But it's a growing scientific consensus that 2º is in fact dangerously high which is bad because we are almost certainly going to blow past 2ºC.
1110,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-094.jpg, But it's a growing scientific consensus that 2º is in fact dangerously high which is bad because we are almost certainly going to blow past 2ºC.

1112,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-096.jpg, There's some reason to believe a recent study said that even if we stopped our carbon emissions tomorrow.
1113,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-097.jpg, We're still going to get more than 3º this century just from momentum from the previous emissions.
1114,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-098.jpg, We're still going to get more than 3º this century just from momentum from the previous emissions.
1115,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-099.jpg, But stopping at 2º now would take a level of global coordination and ambition that is nowhere in evidence.
1116,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-100.jpg, But stopping at 2º now would take a level of global coordination and ambition that is nowhere in evidence.
1117,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-101.jpg, So a lot of climate scientists don't really want to tell you this because they don't want to depress you.
1118,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-102.jpg, But I am just a blogger so I am happy to depress you.
1119,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-103.jpg, 2ºC is probably off the table. 
1120,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-104.jpg, So then the question becomes Well what would it look like if temperature goes higher than that? What would say 4ºC look like?
1121,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-105.jpg, Oddly there hadn't really been a lot of concerted scientific attention to that question because climate scientists honestly thought we wouldn't do that to ourselves but we are doing it to ourselves.
1122,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-106.jpg, Oddly there hadn't really been a lot of concerted scientific attention to that question because climate scientists honestly thought we wouldn't do that to ourselves but we are doing it to ourselves.

1124,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-108.jpg, So in 2009 several climate change research groups in England drew together a group of scientists commissioned some papers and had them really take a hard look for the first time.

1127,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-111.jpg, There are a lot of papers a lot of equations a lot of talk and complexity I have hopefully paraphrased here for you to make it easier to grasp.

1129,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-113.jpg, 4ºC temperature rise would look ugly.
1130,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-114.jpg, Among other things that would be the hottest the Earth has been in 30 million years.
1131,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-115.jpg, Among other things that would be the hottest the Earth has been in 30 million years.
1132,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-116.jpg, Sea-levels would rise at least 3-6 feet.
1133,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-117.jpg, And this excludes some really tail end possibilities but 3-6 feet at least.
1134,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-118.jpg, And persistent drought would cover about 40% of the currently occupied land on Earth which would wreak havoc on agriculture in East Asia Africa South America Western US.

1137,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-121.jpg, Well this combined will produce hundreds of millions of people who have been driven from their homes either by their cities being swamped by sea-level rise or by hunger or by all the attended ills that come along with those things.

1140,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-124.jpg, And to boot probably somewhere around half of the known species on Earth would go extinct.

1142,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-126.jpg, This question of pinning down the exact number of species is very difficult.
1143,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-127.jpg, This is very much an approximation but some substantial chunk of life on Earth would be wiped out.

1145,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-129.jpg, The final bit of bad news... that's not true there's more bad news to come.
1146,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-130.jpg, A middle bit of bad news is that according to a recent paper by the International Energy Agency.
1147,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-131.jpg, A middle bit of bad news is that according to a recent paper by the International Energy Agency.
1148,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-132.jpg, We are currently on track -- if we keep doing what we are now doing.
1149,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-133.jpg, If we go on with business as usual as it's called -- we are now on track for 6ºC temperature rise this century.
1150,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-134.jpg, Something 5-7 these are obviously estimations.
1151,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-135.jpg, So if 4º is hell on Earth.
1152,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-136.jpg, I'll let your imaginations filling the blanks on 6º.
1153,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-137.jpg, But one danger that comes up when we contemplate going this high with our temperature.
1154,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-138.jpg, But one danger that comes up when we contemplate going this high with our temperature.
1155,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-139.jpg, Is the possibility that climate change will become irreversable.
1156,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-140.jpg, I think when people typically think about climate change they think Oh temperature is going to rise X amount.
1157,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-141.jpg, Circumstances will change some places will get warmer.
1158,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-142.jpg, Some places will get wetter we'll adjust we'll move our farms around.
1159,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-143.jpg, People will migrate from one city to another we'll get resettled and we'll go on with life.
1160,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-144.jpg, The really dangerous possibility is that what are called -- the Earth has several of what are called positive feedback systems.
1161,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-145.jpg, The really dangerous possibility is that what are called -- the Earth has several of what are called positive feedback systems.
1162,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-146.jpg, So for instance in Siberia there is this permanent ice the permafrost and it contains a bunch of methane in it.
1163,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-147.jpg, As it melts it releases that methane the methane causes more warming which melts more ice which releases more methane
1164,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-148.jpg, It's a self-sustaining process.
1165,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-149.jpg, Or sea ice melts ice is white it reflects energy when it melts becomes dark blue and absorbs more energy which heats the oceans which melts more ice which creates more dark surfaces.

1167,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-151.jpg, You see there's a number of these systems.
1168,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-152.jpg, That are self-perpetuating and the danger the great danger of climate change.
1169,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-153.jpg, That towers above all these other more specific dangers.
1170,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-154.jpg, Is that these positive feedback systems will take on a momentum of their own that becomes unstoppable.
1171,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-155.jpg, And human beings will lose any ability to control it at all even if we'd stop all our climate emissions on a dime.

1173,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-157.jpg, Will that happen at 2º? 
1174,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-158.jpg, Probably not though there is a real chance of it and there is a lot of debate about that; will it happen at 4º?
1175,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-159.jpg, Well it looks a lot more likely at 4º. Will it happen at 6º?
1176,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-160.jpg, Almost certainly. 
1177,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-161.jpg, So if we continue on our present course climate change will probably take on a life of its own spiral out of control.
1178,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-162.jpg, And according to a recent paper by 2300 we could see temperature rise of up to 12ºC.
1179,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-163.jpg, And according to a recent paper by 2300 we could see temperature rise of up to 12ºC.

1182,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-166.jpg, Something like half the Earth's currently inhabited land would become too hot to survive on.
1183,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-167.jpg, Something like half the Earth's currently inhabited land would become too hot to survive on.
1184,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-168.jpg, And when I say too hot to survive on I don't mean it's difficult to grow beans or air conditioning bills are inconveniently high.
1185,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-169.jpg, I mean if you go outside you die of hotness.
1186,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-170.jpg, I mean places that were an average of 80ºF would be now an average of 170-180ºF.
1187,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-171.jpg, I mean places that were an average of 80ºF would be now an average of 170-180ºF.
1188,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-172.jpg, Literally too hot for human beings to go outside and survive.
1189,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-173.jpg, So will there still be human civilization under those circumstances?
1190,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-174.jpg, Who knows I mean maybe we'll live in underground climate controlled caves.
1191,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-175.jpg, Maybe we'll grow food in test tubes but that wouldn't look anything like Earth as we now know it.
1192,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-176.jpg, It would look a lot more like Newt Gingrich's moon colony assuming any human beings or at least enough to make a civilization survived in those circumstances.

1195,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-179.jpg, So when I say Climate change is simple. -- I know this has been bugging you.
1196,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-180.jpg, You are not used to thinking in Celsius.
1197,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-181.jpg, Those strange European metric temperatures so here is good American Fahrenheit it's just as ugly.
1198,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-182.jpg, So this is what I mean by climate change being simple.
1199,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-183.jpg, There are many complicated and fascinating discussions to be had about what to do about it.
1200,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-184.jpg, Or about what effect our actions might have on the climate.
1201,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-185.jpg, And when or which policies are best based on cost benefit analyses.
1202,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-186.jpg, There is complexity plenty of complexity for those of you who like complexity.
1203,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-187.jpg, But we now know to a fair degree of certainty that if we keep doing what we are now doing we will face unthinkable catastrophe.
1204,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-188.jpg, But we now know to a fair degree of certainty that if we keep doing what we are now doing we will face unthinkable catastrophe.
1205,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-189.jpg, That's the bumper sticker that's the take home message.
1206,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-190.jpg, And that you know saying I don't want to talk about that because I don't know the ins and outs is like saying I don't want to raise alarms about Hitler's army being a hundred miles out.
1207,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-191.jpg, Because I don't know the thread count of their uniforms or I don't know the average calorie intake of a German soldier.
1208,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-192.jpg, Because I don't know the thread count of their uniforms or I don't know the average calorie intake of a German soldier.
1209,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-193.jpg, You don't need to know those things to be scared that the army's on the march and to raise alarms about it.
1210,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-194.jpg, Similarly if we keep doing what we are now doing we are screwed this we know now.
1211,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-195.jpg, Similarly if we keep doing what we are now doing we are screwed this we know now.
1212,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-196.jpg, To stabilize temperature and I don't mean stabilize temperature at 2º or 4º or 6º.
1213,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-197.jpg, I mean to ever have a hope of ever again having a stable temperature of any kind.
1214,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-198.jpg, Global climate change emissions need to peak stop growing peak and start falling rapidly in the next 5-10 years.

1217,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-201.jpg, We add according to the International Energy Agency.
1218,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-202.jpg, An extra 500 billion with a B dollars to the price tag of what it is going to cost us to do this eventually every year we wait.

1220,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-204.jpg, That's $500 billion down the drain.
1221,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-205.jpg, Now you and I look around at current politics.
1222,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-206.jpg, Particularly US politics.
1223,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-207.jpg, And massive coordinated intelligent ambitious action does not strike us as particularly plausible.
1224,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-208.jpg, In fact it might strike us as impossible.
1225,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-209.jpg, But that is where we are stuck between the impossible and the unthinkable.
1226,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-210.jpg, But that is where we are stuck between the impossible and the unthinkable.
1227,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCIS/CCIS_frames/CCIS-211.jpg, So your job anyone who hears this for the rest of your life your job is to make the impossible possible.

1257,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-002.jpg, Welcome to this australian earth science education video.
1258,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-003.jpg, We are going to look at ways that people can mitigate or adapt to the changing climate and its flow-on effects.
1259,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-004.jpg, Mitigation is any action that limits the rate of global warming and its effects.
1260,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-005.jpg, These strategies or features address the problem and are ways that we can fight climate change.
1261,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-006.jpg, Adaptation is learning to live with a warming climate and its effects.
1262,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-007.jpg, Even if we stop any further warming we have to deal with some of the effects we are already experiencing such as increased storms fires and heat.
1263,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-008.jpg, Even if we stop any further warming we have to deal with some of the effects we are already experiencing such as increased storms fires and heat.
1264,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-009.jpg, We are going on a neighborhood scavenger hunt to see how many features we can find that help to address climate change.
1265,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-010.jpg, There are some features that are implemented by the local government or community and others that can be put in place by individual households.
1266,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-011.jpg, We will start with the community services and features.
1267,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-012.jpg, This suburb has good bus service that connects with train stations.
1268,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-013.jpg, Efficient public transport keeps cars off the road and reduces greenhouse gases this counts as mitigation.
1269,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-014.jpg, We have ticked off the bus stops on our list and have followed the buses to the local train station.
1270,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-015.jpg, Trains are a very efficient way of moving large numbers of people.
1271,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-016.jpg, Electric trains like these in sydney can be run using renewable power this is an excellent mitigation measure.
1272,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-017.jpg, Parks and green spaces help to cool urban areas as plants transpire.
1273,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-018.jpg, Cooling urban areas is a way of adapting to climate change.
1274,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-019.jpg, But trees are also a good mitigation strategy because they absorb carbon dioxide from the air and lock it up in wood.
1275,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-020.jpg, Public areas that encourage walking are another climate mitigation strategy.
1276,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-021.jpg, This pedestrian area is surrounded by shops.
1277,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-022.jpg, And right next to the train and bus stations people drive less if they can find what they need in one spot and can get there by public transportation.
1278,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-023.jpg, I didn't find a bicycle path in my area.
1279,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-024.jpg, So can't take off that item in the hunt does your community have any other features that combat climate change?
1280,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-025.jpg, Solar panels are a household climate mitigation feature that is easy to spot.
1281,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-026.jpg, By generating their own solar electricity households are mitigating the effects of climate change.
1282,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-027.jpg, Solar panels may be paired with batteries but batteries are hard to spot from the street.
1283,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-028.jpg, When looking at rooftops you may also see solar water heaters.
1284,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-029.jpg, These come in a variety of designs and are another helpful mitigation strategy that is relatively low cost to adopt.
1285,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-030.jpg, Houses with large deciduous trees outside like this big liquid amber are using an effective adaptation strategy.
1286,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-031.jpg, Houses with large deciduous trees outside like this big liquid amber are using an effective adaptation strategy.
1287,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-032.jpg, Deciduous trees shade the house in summer and allow more sunlight through in winter.
1288,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-033.jpg, It is easiest to spot these trees in the winter when they have dropped their leaves.
1289,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-034.jpg, You may be able to see water tanks in your house water tanks are an adaptation to the more unpredictable rainfall that comes with climate change.
1290,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-035.jpg, Households can collect their own water to help reduce the strain on municipal water supplies.
1291,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-036.jpg, I didn't spot any houses with fireproof shutters in my neighborhood.
1292,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-037.jpg, But these are an adaptation to the increased bushfire risk that comes with climate change.
1293,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-038.jpg, I found some skylights and roof ventilation in my neighborhood.
1294,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-039.jpg, Skylights reduce electricity demand so are mitigation.
1295,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-040.jpg, Roof ventilation lets out excess heat in summer do you think this is adaptation or mitigation.
1296,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-041.jpg, What other features in your local area are response to the effects of changing climate?
1297,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-042.jpg, Consider strategies to combat floods landslides fire and extreme weather.
1298,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-043.jpg, What features are adaptation and which are mitigation?
1299,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCMA/CCMA_frames/CCMA-044.jpg, Can a feature be both? we hope you've enjoyed this video about climate change mitigation and adaptation.

1311,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And I would like to work with you in order to get a solution that actually really transforms what is happening now with the climate action which is just a symptom of something more deepen which is our production and consumption system.

1324,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, We are reading the whole day to launch this sort of campaigns right.
1325,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And this is related to the potential Extinction we're about to face due to climate change.
1326,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, You are probably have heard about the Paris agreement.
1327,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And you we need to understand that the Paris agreement was built over the biggest consensus scientifically and politically in the history of humankind.

1333,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Because I think it's very difficult to embody it right.
1334,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So or having like a tangible data in this term you can read the latest War material logical organization together with the U.N disaster risk management office saying that the forecast for 2030 is one point disasters a day.

1337,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, This is the latest report.
1338,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So 1.5 degrees more is 1.5 disasters a day in this world.
1339,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So 1.5 degrees more is 1.5 disasters a day in this world.
1340,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So that's earthquakes tsunamis floods heat waves.
1341,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Everything that affects obviously people lives but also infrastructure electricity infrastructure and so the internet and so this blockchain.
1342,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Everything that affects obviously people lives but also infrastructure electricity infrastructure and so the internet and so this blockchain.
1343,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Everything that affects obviously people lives but also infrastructure electricity infrastructure and so the internet and so this blockchain.
1344,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So we we really need to be specifically concerned on this.
1345,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, I really recommend you to see this augmentary is very it's very new.
1346,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Because it actually appeals to how we create negation mechanisms when we hear all this information.
1347,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And it happened to me even at the U.N reading all the reports and being part of the report.
1348,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And it happened to me even at the U.N reading all the reports and being part of the report.
1349,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So what what what are you going to do once you know but what are you going to do once you feel it once you get to know where get you feel what you know you have to believe what you know.
1350,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So what what what are you going to do once you know but what are you going to do once you feel it once you get to know where get you feel what you know you have to believe what you know.
1351,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, So this kind of paralyze you or move to action real action.
1352,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, So this kind of paralyze you or move to action real action.
1353,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So going into my diagnosis of why we are here in this situation.
1354,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, I think there's a clear misleading the approach.
1355,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, That is the old the Olin sdgs.
1356,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, You know sdgs Cadbury incredible targets of poverty zero hunger zero clean energy for everyone etc etc right sustainable consumption production.
1357,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, You know sdgs Cadbury incredible targets of poverty zero hunger zero clean energy for everyone etc etc right sustainable consumption production.
1358,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, You know sdgs Cadbury incredible targets of poverty zero hunger zero clean energy for everyone etc etc right sustainable consumption production.
1359,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But we have this sdg which is number eight and promotes indefinite economic growth.
1360,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So going into a very precise example.
1361,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, Everyone wants to go renewable right.
1362,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, Renewable energy.
1363,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But what if tomorrow today we all decide to go 100 Renewables.
1364,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Well we need minerals for that.
1365,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, We need extraction according to the World Bank.
1366,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, We need in order to be aligned with a 1.5 degrees of the police agreement.
1367,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, We need three billion tons of minerals lithium Cobalt graphite which is under the Amazon down the Amazon.
1368,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, so and that will imply a lot of trade-offs in other sectors in other sdgs
1369,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, so and that will imply a lot of trade-offs in other sectors in other sdgs
1370,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, I know obviously a massive amount of burn oil of burnt oil.
1371,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Because we are just moving the the mission of git to other sectors transport extractives and the industry.
1372,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Because we are just moving the the mission of git to other sectors transport extractives and the industry.
1373,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So I was willing to enter the here.
1374,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Dancing one song of The Rolling Stones but due to copyright stuff we had another one.
1375,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But the the Rolling Stones said it in a very nice Way You Can't Always Get What You Want.
1376,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But the the Rolling Stones said it in a very nice Way You Can't Always Get What You Want.
1377,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And that's my part of the song like all in sdg but if you try some time you just might find you get what you need.
1378,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And that's my part of the song like all in sdg but if you try some time you just might find you get what you need.
1379,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So let's see a concrete example of the misleader I'm telling you about.
1380,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, 25 years of the voluntary carbon Market.
1381,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, This is a few to few approach while emissions Rising as you already know.
1382,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So in the demand side the reach offsetters the buyers.
1383,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Coca-Cola Airways car Hill whoever principally from the food and energy sectors which are the most polluting ones the principal generators of climate change.
1384,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Coca-Cola Airways car Hill whoever principally from the food and energy sectors which are the most polluting ones the principal generators of climate change.
1385,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Coca-Cola Airways car Hill whoever principally from the food and energy sectors which are the most polluting ones the principal generators of climate change.
1386,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Look at this data from from Oxfam.
1387,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, During the pandemic when the economy was shrinking 453 new billionaires in this sector that is supposed to offset in order to get below the 1.5.
1388,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, During the pandemic when the economy was shrinking 453 new billionaires in this sector that is supposed to offset in order to get below the 1.5.

1390,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Rich middlemen in 2021 1 billion dollars for the current market.
1391,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Few Traders made in 2021.
1392,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And in the this is the worst part of the of the story because these are the guys in the supply side the guys that are protecting the ecosystems we need to thrive.
1393,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And in the this is the worst part of the of the story because these are the guys in the supply side the guys that are protecting the ecosystems we need to thrive.

1395,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Look at this at this notice from from our community in in India.
1396,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Sorry in Kenya these projects are sending people out.
1397,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And they can even not afford to put into the market their their own Supply their projects because they are made for the rich in order to credit and be able to sell a credit to presenter projects you need.
1398,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And they can even not afford to put into the market their their own Supply their projects because they are made for the rich in order to credit and be able to sell a credit to presenter projects you need.

1400,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, The transaction costs are huge.
1401,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So that's why you have big landowners with with trees with forests claiming reductions from I don't know a hundred thousand hectares Baseline and next year I will do 70 000 you can pay me that.
1402,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So that's why you have big landowners with with trees with forests claiming reductions from I don't know a hundred thousand hectares Baseline and next year I will do 70 000 you can pay me that.

1404,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Is that the sdgs?
1405,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Are them supposed to do that?
1406,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So getting into blockchain.
1407,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, What is happening right now?
1408,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, You probably heard also about the hype of the Eco tokens of tokenizing this voluntary carbon Market credits into the blockchain.
1409,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And it's very interesting you read this research published by Thomson Reuters also like one month ago from a scandal that's what that was raised in Brazil due to a a person that was living in the community where the project was being held that died.
1410,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And it's very interesting you read this research published by Thomson Reuters also like one month ago from a scandal that's what that was raised in Brazil due to a a person that was living in the community where the project was being held that died.

1413,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, He died in the project.
1414,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And due to his death everyone paid attention to it and the scam was off what was leaked.
1415,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So just look at this this crypto company in Brazil has been accused of packed more than 2 million carbon credits and turned them into crypto tokens at times selling the grades for eight times more.
1416,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So just look at this this crypto company in Brazil has been accused of packed more than 2 million carbon credits and turned them into crypto tokens at times selling the grades for eight times more.

1418,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So they mixed in those 2 million they mix very low quality credits with Middle grades and they packed them.
1419,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, So they mixed in those 2 million they mix very low quality credits with Middle grades and they packed them.
1420,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, I mean you know a low quality credit is the one that has no environmental robust asset behind the token right.
1421,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, That's a so the editor who this was a WhatsApp message leaked.
1422,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, The editor who initially approved the project a decade ago found that deforestation may have been displaced to land nearby.
1423,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, The editor who initially approved the project a decade ago found that deforestation may have been displaced to land nearby.
1424,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And that is a violation of one of the main principles of the carbon Market or the voluntary current markets which is permanence.
1425,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, And that is a violation of one of the main principles of the carbon Market or the voluntary current markets which is permanence.
1426,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, But it's very difficult how can we ensure we measure our project it's perfect.
1427,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, How can we ensure that the deforestation going on there does not go to the other land?
1428,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Or maybe another country is a global problem.
1429,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And they didn't even trust they created 150 green job.
1430,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, 150 green jobs for 2 million carbon credits.
1431,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, It's a huge or almost nothing so.
1432,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, We need to know that although this and we we need to remind I think.
1433,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, What blockchain has been built for the the the core principles of blockchain right?
1434,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, How how those could be applied into this?
1435,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, You know Upstream we need to replace those few offsets for those big polluters making new billionaires in the most polluting sectors.
1436,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, You know Upstream we need to replace those few offsets for those big polluters making new billionaires in the most polluting sectors.
1437,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, We need to replace one offset from that those ones from like a participation in that one from all of us savers.
1438,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, We need to replace one offset from that those ones from like a participation in that one from all of us savers.
1439,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Then we as vitalik said we need to automatize the center that's blockchain about and downstream allowing those humans those real populations but probably there's a gap because they cannot reach internet in many cases.
1440,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Then we as vitalik said we need to automatize the center that's blockchain about and downstream allowing those humans those real populations but probably there's a gap because they cannot reach internet in many cases.

1442,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But anyway they are the ones that really have a ignorant willingness to defend ecosystems and the forest because they live in the forest.
1443,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But anyway they are the ones that really have a ignorant willingness to defend ecosystems and the forest because they live in the forest.
1444,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, That's that's inner and transparency right.
1445,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, and that's what blockchain I think in my humble opinion should be about.
1446,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, so but what about the agenda right?
1447,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, I think we need to consider and I would like I've been talking in these days about this because I I I’m not an expert in Dallas nor blockchain as well.
1448,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, I think we need to consider and I would like I've been talking in these days about this because I I I’m not an expert in Dallas nor blockchain as well.
1449,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But these guys are 500 Scholars and former Ministers of environment that presented a letter in the last U.N disaster risk management um conference asking the U.N to replace the sdgs for a more sincere agenda.

1454,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, An agenda that is really aligned with science.
1455,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, That is focus on locally LED adaptation climate adaptation that’s not mitigation to reduce but adaptation how to create resilience for this for infrastructure loads loss we we’ve seen before.

1457,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And also this disaster risk management which is very very important not to lose among other staff the blockchain.
1458,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And also this disaster risk management which is very very important not to lose among other staff the blockchain.

1460,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So are we willing to put ourselves in a position to help these guys to put because they probably don’t know what blockchain is they probably haven’t even think of this.
1461,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So are we willing to put ourselves in a position to help these guys to put because they probably don’t know what blockchain is they probably haven’t even think of this.

1463,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So what if we put what if a ethereum foundation or whoever here wants to collaborate in this
1464,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, We Make some noise and help these guys or through the blockchain governance tools we have create a capacity building and create a pilot a pilot project to really change the world.

1467,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So going back to the many-to-many approach I told in the in the carbon Market or the Eco tokens.
1468,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, This pilot is is not has not been already executed.
1469,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But it’s very interesting how it has been designed
1470,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, Because it was really designed from many to many although it was it was it could not be so ambitious at the beginning.
1471,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, It was really what I’m trying to say in an example.
1472,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, You can see those investors in the middle with the project try to gather from the application of a bank where almost everybody in Argentina.

1474,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, This is for El Taco Argentina in the North um where everyone received their salary.
1475,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So they give the now with this project.
1476,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, They should give the option instead of saving with something else.
1477,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, You can buy an Eco token.
1478,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And in the supply side this is a very interesting interesting part and Diego I think before me.
1479,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, He spoke something of interesting things about this.
1480,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But how the jurisdictional authorities?
1481,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, How can we somehow we need them in our part?
1482,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, They have the infrastructure to reach those territories we don’t have it yet.
1483,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, So the government the governor of Chaco committed at least verbally.
1484,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So this is just an idea remember that.
1485,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But he publicly confirmed that he wanted to do this.
1486,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And he wanted to reach the territories of those ecosystem sorry Echo tokens Revenue to reach directly their populations living in the forests through smart contracts.
1487,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And he wanted to reach the territories of those ecosystem sorry Echo tokens Revenue to reach directly their populations living in the forests through smart contracts.
1488,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And he committed himself to sign a bill in order to sort of delegate his mandate in in that regard.
1489,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And he committed himself to sign a bill in order to sort of delegate his mandate in in that regard.
1490,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And he committed himself to sign a bill in order to sort of delegate his mandate in in that regard.
1491,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Not not the jurisdiction because that’s a legal problem but to delegate.
1492,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And I think that’s a very important role for this for uh for the estate for the government for the old Paradigm to become helper of these two to to actually be Unleashed right.
1493,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And I think that’s a very important role for this for uh for the estate for the government for the old Paradigm to become helper of these two to to actually be Unleashed right.

1495,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And another example I wanted to share with you which is also very very brand new they’re working already.
1496,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And they they are from Colombia
1497,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, They’re from here Echo registry because we need to know what what to do about the transition.
1498,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Because we we have those Coca-Cola Delta Airlines car Hill buyer whatever willing to.
1499,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And and the demand for carbon credits has grown exponentially in the last years.
1500,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And and the demand for carbon credits has grown exponentially in the last years.
1501,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Not the supply because of what I I told you there’s no money to create projects but yes they demand.
1502,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, There’s a there was a 2 billion annual demand for credits in 2021.
1503,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, I think we should harness on but how.
1504,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, This is a very interesting model here in Colombia that is spreading into other countries.
1505,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So they are not going to.
1506,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, They don’t just tokenize a carbon credit whichever the current credit asset quality is.
1507,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But they migrate into blockchain every part of the process of our of the life cycle of our carbon credit from their project design formulation validation verification the issuance the Bison cells that could be before retirement that is when the company the corporation claims the emission reduction.
1508,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, But they migrate into blockchain every part of the process of our of the life cycle of our carbon credit from their project design formulation validation verification the issuance the Bison cells that could be before retirement that is when the company the corporation claims the emission reduction.

1512,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And they are making this very transparent and very efficient to the point that the average in the market of reaching money to the developers is like 25 percent roughly.
1513,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And they are making this very transparent and very efficient to the point that the average in the market of reaching money to the developers is like 25 percent roughly.

1515,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, These guys are reaching now 50 percent.
1516,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And they have a short-term plan of reaching 70 percent so that could be a smart transition.
1517,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, That could be because those numbers those efficiency numbers could make the the transaction cost easier and and lower for the small communities actually to to be involved.
1518,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, That could be because those numbers those efficiency numbers could make the the transaction cost easier and and lower for the small communities actually to to be involved.

1520,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So finally if ethereum vision.
1521,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, This is a web page of ethereum is to grow.
1522,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Remember my slide of the icd8.
1523,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, We need to we need to clearly think and be aware and be aware of what kind of growth and for whom.
1524,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, We need to we need to clearly think and be aware and be aware of what kind of growth and for whom.
1525,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Because humanity is at stake thank you.
1526,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Thank you Augustine we have room for uh some questions somebody want to ask to Augustine we have here I’m gonna go there.
1527,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Just five seconds.
1528,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Thank you so much for the the talk.
1529,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, Really really loved especially the ideas about making you know these markets.
1530,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, These processes more inclusive many to many I think that’s a transition that like all the impact space really needs to go through.
1531,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, When we think about that though how does that marry with the fact that like carbon markets and the capital moving into that space just needs to increase.
1532,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, When we think about that though how does that marry with the fact that like carbon markets and the capital moving into that space just needs to increase.
1533,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Because like the two billion dollar number is a lot but you know it’s probably a tenth a hundred of what we’re going to need exactly.
1534,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Because like the two billion dollar number is a lot but you know it’s probably a tenth a hundred of what we’re going to need exactly.
1535,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Yeah and even more um.
1536,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, No a good question you know yeah.
1537,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-003.jpg, Obviously it’s not the it’s not the solution not at all I think we need to remind the the slide of the of these guys presenting a new agenda.

1539,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, That’s trying to redirect all the international cooperation cooperation system that or the the Paradigm under or the agenda under which this with all the money that he that enters the U.N and also the bilateral corporations and also corporations are flowing the money too.

1542,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, So we need to I think my first answer would be to we need to redefine the politics in order for the tool the blockchain tool to work to to make it happen.

1545,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But we need the politics right?
1546,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, We need to get together them right so yeah voluntary carbon markets is just this.
1547,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But I focus on that because of the hype of the Eco tokens.
1548,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But I focus on that because of the hype of the Eco tokens.
1549,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Thank you for that question any other question if someone wants to do it in Spanish also right.
1550,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Another question there please
1551,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Is with technical...
1552,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, [Spanish]
1553,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, [Spanish]
1554,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, In English or Spanish English or Spanish?
1555,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And English Okay.
1556,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Um.
1557,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Well it’s it’s actually it’s a crazy idea.
1558,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, You know it’s idea that popped into my mind and I share it with Paul here my friend from ethereum.
1559,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, You know it’s idea that popped into my mind and I share it with Paul here my friend from ethereum.
1560,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And I just saw that I I am very involved in the I know a lot of scientists in in the and former ministers and everyone that came from the U.N.
1561,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And I just saw that I I am very involved in the I know a lot of scientists in in the and former ministers and everyone that came from the U.N.
1562,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So I I get I get to see this this letter that has been presented in this in this.
1563,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So I I get I get to see this this letter that has been presented in this in this.
1564,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So it’s it was just an idea because I think my opinion is we need to connect the dots.
1565,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, We need to integrate these two words
1566,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, Those guys that are in my opinion very well aligned in the policy defining the policy for what we are going to need for those 1.5 disasters a day and for the NLC energy transitions by taking taking a look at the territories.
1567,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, Those guys that are in my opinion very well aligned in the policy defining the policy for what we are going to need for those 1.5 disasters a day and for the NLC energy transitions by taking taking a look at the territories.

1569,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, What if we I don’t know think together.
1570,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, How could that hour could look like or many Taos or not.
1571,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, But the other governance tools coming from from the blockchain.
1572,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, So it’s just an idea that we can discuss and we can create it together.
1573,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So thank you thank you there is another question.
1574,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, There please here hi thank you for the talk.
1575,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, I wanted to ask in relation to the idea of many to many uh that sometimes means and and the idea of taken away from the big you know offsetters and empowering the little local impact makers.
1576,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, I wanted to ask in relation to the idea of many to many uh that sometimes means and and the idea of taken away from the big you know offsetters and empowering the little local impact makers.
1577,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, That requires taking the technology to places where it doesn’t really exist right.
1578,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, That requires taking the technology to places where it doesn’t really exist right.
1579,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So how do we Empower how do we create that impact so that it’s local people doing things for themselves instead of the blockchain industry trying to decide on their behalf and think they know what they’re dealing.
1580,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So how do we Empower how do we create that impact so that it’s local people doing things for themselves instead of the blockchain industry trying to decide on their behalf and think they know what they’re dealing.

1582,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, With cool very very interesting question.
1583,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And obviously my first concern when I thought of this was yeah how are we going to reach a person that does not have a cell phone.
1584,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And obviously my first concern when I thought of this was yeah how are we going to reach a person that does not have a cell phone.
1585,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, So I think that sagap that we need to try to reverse in a way.
1586,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, And and I think that we can build over some projects right the other day in the sustainability blockchain Summit
1587,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, I’ve heard uh there was a girl from Coco.
1588,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, I think it’s a it’s called Coco project or coco and she was working in this ah.
1589,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, Here you are here great Amazing Project well you should you should ask her.
1590,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, And we should bring it to the table this is us this is not me.
1591,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, So so let’s link that together thank you.
1592,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Any other question we have time for last question English or Spanish.
1593,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-001.jpg, Or thank you very much Agustin amazing talk.
1594,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCSC/CCSC_frames/CCSC-002.jpg, An amazing job!

1597,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-001.jpg, Climate Change: Take Action
1598,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-002.jpg, Welcome to this australian earth science education video about climate change and how everyone can take action to help fix this problem.
1599,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-003.jpg, We often feel small and helpless in the face of a big problem like climate change.
1600,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-004.jpg, But there are ways everyone can take action to reduce the problem.
1601,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-005.jpg, A good place to start is in the kitchen.
1602,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-006.jpg, Planning meals prevents food waste save leftovers for lunch or a quick dinner.
1603,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-007.jpg, Scraps coffee grounds and tea bags can be composted.
1604,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-008.jpg, Composting food waste produces less greenhouse gas than landfill and produces compost for the garden.
1605,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-009.jpg, Meat has a very large environmental footprint 
1606,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-010.jpg, By eating more vegetables and less meat you not only get to enjoy the wonderful variety of fresh produce but you also help the planet.
1607,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-011.jpg, Transportation choices can make a big difference.
1608,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-012.jpg, If going somewhere close by walk or ride your bike.
1609,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-013.jpg, For longer journeys choose public transportation like a bus or train whenever possible.
1610,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-014.jpg, Public transportation is an efficient way to move many people and reduce greenhouse gases.
1611,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-015.jpg, The clothes you choose and how you care for them are important too.
1612,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-016.jpg, Fast fashion takes a huge toll on our planet because of the water needed to grow cotton.
1613,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-017.jpg, Pollution from dyes waste from creating garments and the 6 000 kilograms of clothing sent to landfill every 10 minutes in australia.
1614,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-018.jpg, By buying quality clothing washing it only when dirty and using a cold water wash you can dramatically reduce the environmental footprint of your clothing choices.
1615,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-019.jpg, By buying quality clothing washing it only when dirty and using a cold water wash you can dramatically reduce the environmental footprint of your clothing choices.
1616,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-020.jpg, We hope that this video has given you some ideas for ways that you can make a difference to climate.
1617,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/CCTA/CCTA_frames/CCTA-021.jpg, We hope that this video has given you some ideas for ways that you can make a difference to climate.

1922,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DFCC/DFCC_frames/DFCC-051.jpg, A warmer climate or a colder climate for that matter affects the forests.
1923,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DFCC/DFCC_frames/DFCC-052.jpg, We know that the force themselves the ones that are here are evolving and moving basically northward and up the slopes.
1924,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DFCC/DFCC_frames/DFCC-053.jpg, Because the the warmer temperatures and everything goes with it chasing them.
1925,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DFCC/DFCC_frames/DFCC-054.jpg, Our fires have going up to what double the rate.
1926,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DFCC/DFCC_frames/DFCC-055.jpg, The insect and disease problems because of that the droughts induce stress and the susceptibility to insect disease damage has gone up by an order of three just in the last 15 years.
1927,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DFCC/DFCC_frames/DFCC-056.jpg, So we have many more acres that have been disturbed that need to be rapidly regenerated.

1936,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-001.jpg, This Is How Denmark Protects Its Cities Against Climate Change
1937,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-002.jpg, Many cities are placed in in coastal areas they are placed near water.
1938,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-003.jpg, And they were not thought out to deal with a time where water levels are rising where there are more flooding and there are more heavy rainfalls.
1939,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-004.jpg, So to get Danish cities ready for this new climate we asked them to do three things.
1940,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-005.jpg, Number one is that in my time as Minister we actually gave these cities maps to work with digital atlases over their city.
1941,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-006.jpg, Number one is that in my time as Minister we actually gave these cities maps to work with digital atlases over their city.
1942,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-007.jpg, So they could actually map where would the water come if we have a heavy rainfall.
1943,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-008.jpg, Where will the water go which areas are most vulnerable and which areas do we have to protect to in order to handle like real emergency.
1944,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-009.jpg, Number two we asked all municipalities to have emergency plans.
1945,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-010.jpg, Number two we asked all municipalities to have emergency plans.
1946,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-011.jpg, So what will we do if we see a water a storm coming?
1947,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-012.jpg, And actually now we have weather data so we can actually prepare for storms coming.
1948,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-013.jpg, And it could be simple things like we need to run to this area and throw sandbags in order to guide the water somewhere else than to the hospital or to the most commercial areas with the highest value.
1949,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-014.jpg, And it could be simple things like we need to run to this area and throw sandbags in order to guide the water somewhere else than to the hospital or to the most commercial areas with the highest value.
1950,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-015.jpg, I mean where do you direct the water?
1951,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-016.jpg, Where does it do the least damage have emergency plans ready.
1952,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-017.jpg, Number three we ask everyone to help us handle this new scenario where we have to deal with much much more water at the same time in the systems.
1953,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-018.jpg, So what we need to do is think of ways to store water in ways where it's not a problem in itself.
1954,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-019.jpg, So what we need to do is think of ways to store water in ways where it's not a problem in itself.
1955,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-020.jpg, So instead of spending a lot of money on just building a system and using concrete and taking away space in the city for instance.
1956,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-021.jpg, So instead of spending a lot of money on just building a system and using concrete and taking away space in the city for instance.
1957,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-022.jpg, You could maybe use this same money for building a skateboard ramp where you could actually store as much water as 25 swimming pools when it rains heavily.
1958,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-023.jpg, You could maybe use this same money for building a skateboard ramp where you could actually store as much water as 25 swimming pools when it rains heavily.
1959,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-024.jpg, So you would then create a whole area that had a multifunctional system.
1960,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-025.jpg, So my advice would be to take a three step approach get your maps ready.
1961,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-026.jpg, So you know where the water will hit and which areas are vulnerable to make sure that you have emergency plans.
1962,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-027.jpg, And three try to think of new ways of storing water where you solve several problems at the same time.
1963,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DPIC/DPIC_frames/DPIC-028.jpg, It's much cheaper it's a much better way of handling this extra water instead of paying for cleaning it up afterwards.

1972,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-008.jpg, It is challenging for the youth to take part in the decision making process.
1973,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-009.jpg, There are few representatives in decision-making bodies not only at the national level but even to the local levels.
1974,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-010.jpg, This makes their voice not be heard and makes them marginalised.
1975,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-011.jpg, Being a pastoralist community is very good and at the same time it is very hard for the women as well as youth.
1976,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-012.jpg, Because they don't have a say in any decision making space.
1977,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-013.jpg, All decisions concerning the resources at home are left with the men.
1978,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-014.jpg, The project is so-called 'Strengthening women and youth voices for climate action in Tanzania'.
1979,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-015.jpg, But that project resulted to create an amazing toolkit so called the Pamoja Voices toolkit.
1980,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-016.jpg, The toolkit is so amazing and impressive.  
1981,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-017.jpg, Why? Because firstly from the grassroots level dig deep and dives into the voices of people.
1982,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-018.jpg, The aim of the Pamoja Voices toolkit essentially was to support rural communities and local cooperatives become more inclusive ensuring the voices of women and youth in particular were heard and contribute equally to decision making.

1985,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-021.jpg, There is a significant amount of complexity even at the most local level needed to survive climate risks.
1986,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-022.jpg, There is a significant amount of complexity even at the most local level needed to survive climate risks.
1987,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-023.jpg, What the tools do is lead to an action plan that a community or a local government can then actively consider and put into place that will ensure that responses to climate hazards do benefit people in a way that suits their situations and priorities.

1990,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-026.jpg, We invited our grassroots partners to present the Pamoja Voices toolkit at the community-based adaptation conference.
1991,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-027.jpg, It had a really good response.
1992,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-028.jpg, All the cooperatives that use this toolkit have committed to implementing actions produced as a result of their action plan.
1993,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-029.jpg, All the cooperatives that use this toolkit have committed to implementing actions produced as a result of their action plan.

1995,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-031.jpg, After using the Pamoja Voice toolkit seaweed farming cooperatives took practical steps to become more accessible to older women and young women
1996,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-032.jpg, Some organisations or some cooperatives have changed their leadership structure.
1997,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-033.jpg, Because you can find that in some cooperatives there was not even a single young person in the leadership structures.
1998,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-034.jpg, Because you can find that in some cooperatives there was not even a single young person in the leadership structures.

2000,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-036.jpg, So this shows that the toolkit has positively impacted to these cooperatives.
2001,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-037.jpg, The government of Zanzibar the Department for Cooperatives has expressed an interest in integrating this toolkit directly into their guidance for all new forming cooperatives which would be a fantastic achievement.

2007,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-043.jpg, It will give us a clear picture of what the community really needs concerning women and youth empowerment.
2008,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-044.jpg, The toolkit I think will somehow cure this notion behind that.
2009,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/DTECC/DTECC_frames/DTECC-045.jpg, Only men can make the decision; it will be a community that is led by both men and women and youth.

2116,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-001.jpg,How Climate Change /Actually/ Works...in 4 Minutes
2117,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-002.jpg,good morning john so probably you have heard that for a long time the amount of energy entering the earth's atmosphere and the amount leaving the earth's atmosphere was about the same 
2118,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-003.jpg,and that was good because if those two numbers are not equal then we're either getting colder every year or we're getting hotter every year 
2119,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-004.jpg,but now it looks like there is in fact more energy coming in than going out 
2120,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-005.jpg,and that results in basically three things 
2121,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-006.jpg,first more heat which is what we call like individual molecules moving faster which is wild 
2122,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-007.jpg,like when you are hot it is because the molecules that make up your body are jiggling more doesn't seem real but it is
2123,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-008.jpg,second you have more severe weather which is when a lot of molecules together move around more 
2124,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-009.jpg,and because of those two you have number three which is probably the worst of them 
2125,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-010.jpg,things are different that doesn't sound so bad except that we have built a tremendous amount of our human infrastructure designed based on the idea that things will be roughly the same now as they were in the past with regards to rainfall and temperature and stuff like that 
2126,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-011.jpg,things are different that doesn't sound so bad except that we have built a tremendous amount of our human infrastructure designed based on the idea that things will be roughly the same now as they were in the past with regards to rainfall and temperature and stuff like that 
2127,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-012.jpg,when that stuff changes crops might have dramatically lower yields resulting in very hungry people 
2128,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-013.jpg,people might use their air conditioners way more than in the past so entire power grids fail 
2129,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-014.jpg,or forests that grew in areas that once had shorter dry seasons might burn up in fires
2130,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-015.jpg,so that's bad and always the first thing you should ask when something bad is happening is why is that happening
2131,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-016.jpg,well you know when you go outside wearing a black t-shirt you get hotter faster than if you're wearing a white t-shirt 
2132,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-017.jpg,that's because things only look black if they absorb all of the visible light that is hitting them
2133,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-018.jpg,if the light was not being absorbed it would either be reflected as white light or as a mirror or it would be clear which would be a strange choice for a shirt 
2134,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-019.jpg,so if you're wearing a white shirt the visible light isn't being absorbed it's being reflected and that's why you're less hot
2135,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-020.jpg,absorb reflect or let pass through that's basically the only three things that a material can do with light
2136,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-021.jpg,and if the light is being absorbed that means the energy of the light hit the molecule in such a way that it's creating movement in the molecule 
2137,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-022.jpg,the light no longer exists the energy is now movement
2138,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-023.jpg,and that movement can be transferred to other molecules just like a cue ball hitting a pool ball 
2139,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-024.jpg,there are basically two ways a molecule can heat up and we just talked about both of them
2140,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-025.jpg,the first is that a photon travels through space and then gets absorbed by a molecule and speeds up that molecule that's heat from radiation 
2141,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-026.jpg,and the second way is that a particle that's jiggling a lot hits a particle that's jiggling less and transfers its heat to that other molecule
2142,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-027.jpg,when that happens in a solid we call it conduction when it happens in a fluid we call it convection 
2143,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-028.jpg,so like when you're in the shade 99 of the heat you are feeling is from convection it's molecules in the air running into you and transferring their heat to you 
2144,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-029.jpg,but when you're in the sun it's a mix of both the radiation and the convection which is why it's hotter in the sun 
2145,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-030.jpg,now different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light 
2146,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-031.jpg,like this book cover is mostly absorbing everything but yellow and this one is mostly absorbing everything but red 
2147,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-032.jpg,and the red and the yellow are being reflected back and this can also happen with gases 
2148,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-033.jpg,there can be green gases and yellow gases and brown gases 
2149,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-034.jpg,but the two molecules of interest here carbon dioxide and methane they don't absorb any light in the visible spectrum which means that they are clear we can't see them 
2150,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-035.jpg,one of the problems with methane actually if your house is filling up with it you need to make sure that you know that that's happening but you can't see it 
2151,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-036.jpg,but at certain infrared wavelengths which the sun creates a lot of they are black 
2152,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-037.jpg,and when we put more of them in the atmosphere our atmosphere is a little less clear in those wavelengths and it's a little more black 
2153,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-038.jpg,those molecules absorb photons they start to move around faster they knock into other molecules which also start to move around faster they push on each other more and more until they have lower pressure and that hot air starts to rise
2154,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-039.jpg,those molecules absorb photons they start to move around faster they knock into other molecules which also start to move around faster they push on each other more and more until they have lower pressure and that hot air starts to rise
2155,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-040.jpg,cooler denser air rushes in to take its place and that's weather now
2156,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-041.jpg,those hot air molecules might remove more moisture from the soil resulting in more wildfires 
2157,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-042.jpg,they might evaporate more water from the ocean resulting in bigger storms 
2158,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-043.jpg,we know that this happens we know how this happens we know why this happens and we know what the effects are 
2159,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-044.jpg,and we know that the only way to stop it is for there to be less co2 and methane in the atmosphere but that is a very hard thing to do
2160,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-045.jpg,it's very hard and expensive to remove those things from the atmosphere 
2161,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-046.jpg,it's very hard and very expensive to replace the agriculture and energy and transportation infrastructure that results in the release of those gases 
2162,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-047.jpg,it is not an easy problem to solve but we have a very strong grip on what the problem is 
2163,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HCCAW/HCCAW_frames/HCCAW-048.jpg,and i think people can solve basically any problem if only we can agree that it exists john i'll see you on tuesday

2223,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-004.jpg,I think that medical anthropology traditionally focuses on human health but from a biological or linguistic or cultural or social perspective

2227,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-008.jpg,so I think we're augmenting that field of study by the type of work we do 
2228,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-009.jpg,and I can say from the perspective of a meteorologist that it's really been eye-opening to have an inter-district disciplinary collaboration like we do   
2229,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-010.jpg,in particular I think as meteorologists we tend to see problems from our perspective 
2230,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-011.jpg,and in terms of human health issues you rapidly realize particularly through fieldwork that there are really a lot of different drivers that can determine a given human health outcome of which weather and climate are only one

2235,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-016.jpg,some of the questions are trying to gain a basic understanding of how climate sensitive disease systems work
2236,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-017.jpg,other questions we address are really linked at developing decision support tools that can help made stakeholders such as mosquito control personnel or Public Health decision makers and in making their decisions

2241,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-022.jpg,we often work on dengue fever which is a mosquito-borne disease 
2242,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-023.jpg,and so when we go out into the field we're really collecting data on the mosquitoes but also on the humans they bite as well as the different types of ecological settings in which we find both the humans and the mosquitoes 
2243,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-024.jpg,and so when we go out into the field we're really collecting data on the mosquitoes but also on the humans they bite as well as the different types of ecological settings in which we find both the humans and the mosquitoes 
2244,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-025.jpg,so we collect immature mosquitoes which is no easy task let me tell you
2245,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-026.jpg,when you have a little pipette and you're going from container to container whether it's a tire or a bucket 
2246,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-027.jpg,and you're trying to take out larvae and pupae 
2247,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-028.jpg,it's very time consuming but we also collect adult mosquito 
2248,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-029.jpg,and we like to talk to humans in the field because we're interested in what they're doing to protect themselves from mosquito-borne diseases
2249,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-030.jpg,so for example do they have windows and doors that are screened
2250,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-031.jpg,do they wear repellent at the times of day when the mosquitos biting 
2251,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-032.jpg,do they empty the standing water in which the mosquitoes lay their eggs that type of thing
2252,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-033.jpg,one of the questions we often receive is will climate change make have adverse effects on human health 
2253,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-034.jpg,and I think for many of the problems that Mary and I study the answer is that climate change has the potential to exacerbate human health issues or to create more suitable conditions for disease transmission 
2254,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-035.jpg,and I think for many of the problems that Mary and I study the answer is that climate change has the potential to exacerbate human health issues or to create more suitable conditions for disease transmission 
2255,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-036.jpg,and I think for many of the problems that Mary and I study the answer is that climate change has the potential to exacerbate human health issues or to create more suitable conditions for disease transmission 
2256,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-037.jpg,so if it's warmer it can go through more generations and you can get more mosquitoes 
2257,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-038.jpg,it also affects how long the adult mosquitoes live 
2258,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-039.jpg,it affects how quickly viruses can replicate how quickly they can incubate within the mosquito the kind of efficiency with which it can transmit a virus
2259,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-040.jpg,it affects how quickly viruses can replicate how quickly they can incubate within the mosquito the kind of efficiency with which it can transmit a virus
2260,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-041.jpg,so lots of ways water through rainfall also provides habitats for mosquitoes 
2261,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-042.jpg,so numerous ways and weather can also affect human behavior
2262,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-043.jpg,it can make for example in warm conditions people might be outdoors more or
2263,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-044.jpg,if it's rainy they might be indoors more so their exposure to disease vectors changes with the weather as well 
2264,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-045.jpg,but again there are all of these other factors that we also have to consider in the future like how will human behavior change 
2265,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-046.jpg,how will socio-economic conditions change
2266,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-047.jpg,what types of changes in medical technology will occur for example will a vaccine for a given vector-borne disease be developed 
2267,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-048.jpg,what types of changes in medical technology will occur for example will a vaccine for a given vector-borne disease be developed 
2268,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-049.jpg,so there are also other factors that could change the outcome future outcomes of human health in addition to climate
2269,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-050.jpg,I think one of the other things I was going to mention is an NSF funded project for which Andy was the PI 
2270,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-051.jpg,I think one of the other things I was going to mention is an NSF funded project for which Andy was the PI 
2271,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-052.jpg,we found the mosquito Aedes aegypti at 2100 meters so we were able to document it for the first time at that elevation in Mexico 
2272,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-053.jpg,and in this particular town where we found the mosquito we had seen 0.2 degrees Celsius rise in temperature each decade for the past four decades
2273,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-054.jpg,and in this particular town where we found the mosquito we had seen 0.2 degrees Celsius rise in temperature each decade for the past four decades
2274,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-055.jpg,one of the interesting things we found is that there are no socio-economic or other behavioral barriers to this mosquito being able to establish in those higher elevation areas 
2275,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-056.jpg,one of the interesting things we found is that there are no socio-economic or other behavioral barriers to this mosquito being able to establish in those higher elevation areas

2277,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-058.jpg,so and that's important because up on the Altiplano that's near mexico city where we have about 20 million people who currently are exposed to the viruses that this mosquito transmits
2278,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-059.jpg,so and that's important because up on the Altiplano that's near mexico city where we have about 20 million people who currently are exposed to the viruses that this mosquito transmits
2279,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-060.jpg,many of the hotspots that we see for vector borne diseases today are in low-income countries in where people's vulnerability is high and in tropical and subtropical areas where their exposure to disease vectors is also high
2280,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-061.jpg,many of the hotspots that we see for vector borne diseases today are in low-income countries in where people's vulnerability is high and in tropical and subtropical areas where their exposure to disease vectors is also high

2282,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-063.jpg,in terms of where future hotspots might be 
2283,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-064.jpg,I think that's one of the questions that were very interested in getting at 
2284,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-065.jpg,and while we might be able to kind of get at some of the future exposure issues how exposure might change 
2285,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-066.jpg,we're having more difficulty answering how human vulnerability might change in the future 
2286,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-067.jpg,we're having more difficulty answering how human vulnerability might change in the future 
2287,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-068.jpg,and I think even in some of the countries that we consider middle-income countries 
2288,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-069.jpg,we see areas we see pockets within those countries of poverty 
2289,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-070.jpg,and those are the areas where we have the most difficulty with vector borne diseases because people have fewer resources to protect themselves 
2290,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-071.jpg,they don't necessarily have air-conditioning and we see this in the southern United States as well at some of our poorest counties
2291,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-072.jpg,along the texas-mexico border for example our areas where we've seen repeated outbreaks of dengue fever 
2292,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-073.jpg,and along those lines this with vector control or trying to keep the mosquitos at bay those vector control agencies are often funded by taxes 
2293,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-074.jpg,and along those lines this with vector control or trying to keep the mosquitos at bay those vector control agencies are often funded by taxes 
2294,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-075.jpg,and if you're in a area where the socio-economic conditions are somewhat lower you may have fewer resources to control mosquitoes as well
2295,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-076.jpg,and if you're in a area where the socio-economic conditions are somewhat lower you may have fewer resources to control mosquitoes as well 
2296,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-077.jpg,we've had many different vector borne diseases in the Americas for a long time
2297,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-078.jpg,we had yellow fever in Spanish Florida in the 1640s
2298,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-079.jpg,there's a dengue outbreak in Philadelphia in the 1780s  
2299,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-080.jpg,and so throughout much of the Americas climate has been suitable for vector borne diseases 
2300,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-081.jpg,and what we've seen in terms of for example a contraction of vector-borne disease transmission in the United States has not been attributed to you know kind of unsuitable climate
2301,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-082.jpg,and what we've seen in terms of for example a contraction of vector-borne disease transmission in the United States has not been attributed to you know kind of unsuitable climate
2302,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-083.jpg,it's more improved socio-economic conditions and people becoming less exposed to mosquito vectors over the years 
2303,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-084.jpg,so this underscores how important it is when we look at the potential for climate change in fact to to affect vector borne diseases 
2304,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-085.jpg,that we also look at human behavior on socio-economic factors 
2305,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-086.jpg,we have a very unique program here at NCAR in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention whereby we bring in postdoctoral fellows for two years 
2306,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-087.jpg,we have a very unique program here at NCAR in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention whereby we bring in postdoctoral fellows for two years 
2307,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-088.jpg,and these fellows spend a year here at NCAR learning about our weather climate and health program and working on developing climate models 
2308,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-089.jpg,and these fellows spend a year here at NCAR learning about our weather climate and health program and working on developing climate models 
2309,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-090.jpg,and then they spend a year at CDC also working on modeling but also learning more about Epidemiology 
2310,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-091.jpg,so we feel that we have a unique cohort of fellows who graduated from this program 
2311,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-092.jpg,and we'll have two more coming in shortly
2312,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-093.jpg,but they're able to bridge that gap between climate and health from both sides of the coin
2313,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-094.jpg,so I think that the field will continue to be a healthy one as we move into the future no panic intended
2314,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HHVBD/HHVBD_frames/HHVBD-095.jpg,

2320,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSHWA/HSHWA_frames/HSHWA-003.jpg,so my name is olaf meynecke and we have been working with well Bush operators in Australia on the gold coast
2321,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSHWA/HSHWA_frames/HSHWA-004.jpg,and we were hoping to get the web operators involved in process to basically determine some strategies to respond to climate change that may impact the industry

2324,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSHWA/HSHWA_frames/HSHWA-007.jpg,so one of the things that we identified is of course be more flexible
2325,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSHWA/HSHWA_frames/HSHWA-008.jpg,because at the end of the day what we are expecting was the changes as in terms of weather and changes of the migration is that there is you know a need of faster response to do such changes
2326,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSHWA/HSHWA_frames/HSHWA-009.jpg,because at the end of the day what we are expecting was the changes as in terms of weather and changes of the migration is that there is you know a need of faster response to do such changes

2328,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSHWA/HSHWA_frames/HSHWA-011.jpg,so today is a good day tomorrow it's raining at windy so I can't go out
2329,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSHWA/HSHWA_frames/HSHWA-012.jpg,so I need to be flexible and I need to provide flexible solutions in terms of for instance give three trips on a sunny nice day

2350,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSPW/HSPW_frames/HSPW-002.jpg,to put it simply this energy comes from the Sun 
2351,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSPW/HSPW_frames/HSPW-002.jpg,specifically solar panels harness energy from the Sun and converts it into electricity in order to power homes and businesses
2352,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/HSPW/HSPW_frames/HSPW-002.jpg,they do this by exciting electrons and silicon cells using the photons of light from the Sun

2429,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,well you might not be an expert on all of these things but you're probably aware of climate change
2430,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,when someone says global warming you might think of images like these 
2431,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,factories and vehicles that emit pollution and carbon dioxide but actually that's not the whole picture
2432,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,what about cows livestock emissions may even contribute more to climate change than car emissions 
2433,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,they're powerful because they are not composed of carbon dioxide but of a different greenhouse gas methane 
2434,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,they're powerful because they are not composed of carbon dioxide but of a different greenhouse gas methane 
2435,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,so how do these greenhouse gases work?
2436,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,well when sunlight hits the earth part of it is absorbed and re-emitted as invisible infrared light into space 
2437,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-002.jpg,greenhouse gases like co2 molecules in the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of the energy and then re-emitted keeping the earth at a comfortable temperature for life as we know it
2438,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-002.jpg,greenhouse gases like co2 molecules in the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of the energy and then re-emitted keeping the earth at a comfortable temperature for life as we know it
2439,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,with more co2 in the atmosphere more energy is absorbed and held back on earth
2440,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,however co2 can only absorb some frequencies of energy and so each new co2 molecule has less of an additional effect
2441,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,however co2 can only absorb some frequencies of energy and so each new co2 molecule has less of an additional effect
2442,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-002.jpg,there's just so much energy of that range that's already been captured 
2443,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,on the other hand methane absorbs different frequencies than co2 
2444,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,adding just a little bit of methane to the atmosphere suddenly has a great effect because it can catch some range of energy that was missed by the thick layers of co2 already in the atmosphere
2445,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,adding just a little bit of methane to the atmosphere suddenly has a great effect because it can catch some range of energy that was missed by the thick layers of co2 already in the atmosphere 
2446,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,so where does all this methane come from?
2447,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,under high pressures in cold temperatures water molecules trap these methane molecules and create a sort of chemical cage around them call the clathrate
2448,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,under high pressures in cold temperatures water molecules trap these methane molecules and create a sort of chemical cage around them call the clathrate
2449,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,as temperatures rise these clathrate cages become unstable and break into water and methane gas 
2450,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,these clathrates are found in the deep ocean where there is high water pressure 
2451,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,however as climate changes these solid methane deposits expand into gash forming bulges in the ocean ground 
2452,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,these hills grow and burst releasing methane bubbles through the ocean and into the atmosphere 
2453,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,just one cubric meter of clathrates can release 164 cubic meters of free gas
2454,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,now that's a lot of methane
2455,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,furthermore large deposits of frozen organic material are located under the Siberian tundra 
2456,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,this organic material contains methane who like a clathrate
2457,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,with rising temperatures the permafrost will melt releasing methane gas along with carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
2458,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,but why worry about methane 
2459,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,what about forest loss rising ocean levels energy needs and what about the apocalypse 
2460,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,well hopefully that's not anytime soon 
2461,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,but as you might have figured out by now these problems all are interrelated
2462,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,carbon dioxide emissions increase warming which melts ice and releases methane into the air while causing oceans to rise 
2463,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-003.jpg,that methane causes more warming which melts more ice and releases even more methane
2464,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,it's a cycle and it's not even that simple 
2465,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,methane acts on every scale from the atomic to the geological 
2466,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-001.jpg,and what's more the full extent of its effects are still not entirely understood
2467,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-002.jpg,but both carbon dioxide and methane are big problems and methane might be the easier one to solve 
2468,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/MICC/MICC_frames/MICC-002.jpg,so this is where we need you scientists and engineers are hard at work on ideas such as generating clean energy from excess methane in factories and land fields oceans and farms

2569,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-004.jpg,while the men were walking on the moon I was glued to the reef
2570,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-005.jpg,it's got habitat that supports thousands upon thousands of species
2571,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-006.jpg,all of which work together to make this a wonderful place 
2572,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-007.jpg,the Great Barrier Reef is still great but it's facing some challenges that we need to deal with
2573,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-008.jpg,we've got climate change now that's that's really the number one threat 
2574,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-009.jpg,some of the work we've done on Heron Island has really started to look at recreating the future and exploring what ecosystems will look like if you change the co2 and change the temperature

2577,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-012.jpg,you take water from the reef crest it flows through a special chamber which adds co2 and temperature 
2578,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-013.jpg,and you can then replicate what happens in a world in which we don't deal with co2
2579,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-014.jpg,and what you see is really interesting 
2580,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-015.jpg,reef one you have much of what you got today
2581,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-016.jpg,but if you don't take action on climate change you get to reef two 
2582,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-017.jpg,and that's where the corals are disappeared all the invertebrates all these little creatures that live around those reefs are disappeared and the reef is collapsed

2585,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-020.jpg,if you do something you can get to a condition where actually you do preserve a lot of coral 
2586,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-021.jpg,the experiments do have a message of hope we take action on climate change we'll still have a reef that functions like a reef 
2587,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/PWCCA/PWCCA_frames/PWCCA-022.jpg,and that that's really important because once this is gone and it will be if we don't deal with the emissions of co2 then we will have lost something that can never be brought back

2594,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-003.jpg,but that's not enough anymore so we also need to be looking at the new technologies that we can use to start to pull those greenhouse gases back out of the atmosphere as well

2597,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-006.jpg,these range from the nano scale to the very large scale land-use change options and everything in between 
2598,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-007.jpg,those are things which are relatively well documented as possibilities 
2599,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-008.jpg,and there's about two dozen of those 
2600,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-009.jpg,but what I'm really interested in is where ANU can add to that list by bringing together our expertise across discipline so that we can actually start to have additional things to that list which other people haven't thought of before

2605,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-014.jpg,so this issue doesn't exist in isolation 
2606,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-015.jpg,when we're dealing with large-scale issues about emission removal we're dealing with billions of tons of carbon dioxide 
2607,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-016.jpg,it has to be massive scaled and that means it's going to impact on other issues impact on land use impact on water impact on innovation 
2608,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-017.jpg,so we really need to take a very comprehensive we need to go to the approach  
2609,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-018.jpg,and I think that's one of the strengths of amu where we can actually bring together a seriously interdisciplinary approach

2614,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RAGG/RAGG_frames/RAGG-023.jpg,but we're going to continue to struggle with the fact that society and politicians aren't overly invested in this problem

2780,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-005.jpg,I coordinate the annual volunteer counting of plants 
2781,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-006.jpg,these are the findings for the very rare snake’s head fritillary if you can see last year's count fell dramatically to almost zero 
2782,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-007.jpg,we've been counting at North Meadow in Wilshire one of Britain's best protected floodplanes
2783,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-008.jpg,but it was flooded for an unprecedented 10 months from May 2012 to April 2013
2784,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-009.jpg,and the effect on the snake’s head fritillary population was staggering 
2785,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-010.jpg,"in 2012 we recorded 1,800 individual plants in 2013 we recorded only 5"
2786,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-011.jpg,so I'm off to North Meadow to find out what the population looks like this year 
2787,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-012.jpg,we don't know whether dorcy is possible or whether the fritillary will have disappeared
2788,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-013.jpg,floodplanes are part of our natural habitat
2789,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-014.jpg,and species-rich floodplane Meadows were once common across most of the UK's lowland river systems
2790,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-015.jpg,traditionally a rich source of hay and offering excellent grazing land 
2791,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-016.jpg,they are today home to an abundance of beautiful and rare plants 
2792,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-017.jpg,but how are these plants coping with some of the biggest floods Britain has seen for many decades 
2793,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/RPDCC/RPDCC_frames/RPDCC-018.jpg,so what we're doing counting these fritillary is really valuable in terms of understanding their ecology understanding how they function in a changing climate

3205,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-002.jpg,Let's now go back and revisit what is climate change.
3206,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-003.jpg,The first thing that we realize that's significantly different is that we've got almost a watt per square metre of extra energy
3207,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-004.jpg,The first thing that we realize that's significantly different is that we've got almost a watt per square metre of extra energy
3208,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-005.jpg,and when we think about how that extra energy is distributed around the surface of the Earth it's not going to be uniform 
3209,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-006.jpg,we're going to have areas where it's higher and areas where it's lower
3210,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-007.jpg,and so we've got an intensification in a local scale. 
3211,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-008.jpg,Now you can see why we're getting these intense thunderstorms very high winds big hail storms tornadoes.
3212,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-009.jpg,The intensification of the gradients which cause local weather are manifesting themselves in these extreme events.
3213,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-010.jpg,The intensification of the gradients which cause local weather are manifesting themselves in these extreme events.
3214,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-011.jpg,The rate of urbanization and the rate at which we are emitting carbon dioxide is very rapid and has not levelled off 
3215,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-012.jpg,The rate of urbanization and the rate at which we are emitting carbon dioxide is very rapid and has not levelled off 
3216,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-013.jpg,The rate of urbanization and the rate at which we are emitting carbon dioxide is very rapid and has not levelled off 
3217,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-014.jpg,and so this means that the atmosphere is in a continuous flux 
3218,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-015.jpg,and that has consequences for what to expect in the future   
3219,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-016.jpg,because we're not going to get oscillations and then a new equilibrium because we keep changing the ballpark  
3220,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-017.jpg,and so these oscillations are going to continue until such time as we can level off the carbon dioxide emissions or at least the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and the amount of urbanization that we are inflicting upon the landscape
3221,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-018.jpg,and so these oscillations are going to continue until such time as we can level off the carbon dioxide emissions or at least the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and the amount of urbanization that we are inflicting upon the landscape
3222,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-019.jpg,and so these oscillations are going to continue until such time as we can level off the carbon dioxide emissions or at least the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and the amount of urbanization that we are inflicting upon the landscape
3223,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-020.jpg,What that means in terms of extreme events 
3224,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-021.jpg,it's a little bit difficult to answer. 
3225,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-022.jpg,We certainly expect the intensity and the frequency of occurrence to continue increasing for some time.  
3226,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-023.jpg,But danger is and something that people especially in the insurance will I suspect are very worried about is that these events are going to become much larger in scale.
3227,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-024.jpg,But danger is and something that people especially in the insurance will I suspect are very worried about is that these events are going to become much larger in scale.
3228,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-025.jpg,So we're going to be getting very large disaster areas and we've seen evidence of this
3229,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-026.jpg,the fires for example earlier in 2020 that took out a lot of Southern New South Wales

3232,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WICCE/WICCE_frames/WICCE-029.jpg,Flooding over large areas heat waves these are all things that we expect to continue to occur with increased frequency and intensity.

3252,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WISE/WISE_frames/WISE-017.jpg,basically solar panels use the Sun to generate power instead of burning non-renewable resources like coal and natural gases
3253,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WISE/WISE_frames/WISE-018.jpg,the energy they created is clean and they reduce the amount of climate changing chemicals into the air

3255,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WISE/WISE_frames/WISE-020.jpg,also solar panels create regional cooling by converting incoming solar energy to electricity
3256,1,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/WISE/WISE_frames/WISE-021.jpg,by switching over to solar panels Nick is also helping to fight against climate change which plays a role in all the storms that Nick hates so much

3303,2,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/YPTL/YPTL_frames/YPTL-014.jpg,one among Democrats Democrats actually had already believed that climate change was happening in human-caused and worried about it
3304,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/YPTL/YPTL_frames/YPTL-015.jpg,but for them they've also really increased their sense that this is a high national priority for the President and for Congress 
3305,0,/workspace/MultiClimate/dataset/YPTL/YPTL_frames/YPTL-016.jpg,but back on those core beliefs of that is happening in human cause the real change there has not been among Democrats and it hasn't been among independents
